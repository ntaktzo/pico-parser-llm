With sample sizes ranging from 8 to 160 patients (Benzo et al., 2007) and an average death rate of 2.6% The arbitrary use of cut-off values for defining patient groups with no adverse outcome carries a large
degree of imprecision; for example, the 95% binomial CI of no adverse outcomes in a typical sample of 30
patients would be 0-13.6%. (Lim et al., 2010)

A non-systematic review of 37 studies of surgery in the elderly with NSCLC (Weinmann et al., 2003)
concluded that careful preoperative assessment of a patient including vigorous techniques of
improvement of their physical and mental status are a must for a successful treatment outcome in elderly oncological stage, co-morbidity and physiological testing.

This process was carried out by discipline specific sub-groups. The GDG signed off the entire list of clinical

assessed over a short time span. Similarly, no adjustment is made for inflation. The analysis does not
contain a sensitivity analysis as it is primarily an observational rather than a modelling study. It does
clearly report error bounds on all the principal outcome measures reported.
The authors find no statistically significant difference in QALYs between the two procedures, hence they
conclude them to be equally effective. They find the mean costs of PLT and TL to be $12,119 and $10,084

The observational epidemiologic study of persons with the disease (or other
outcome variable) of interest and a suitable control (comparison, reference)
group of persons without the disease. The relationship of an attribute to the
disease is examined by comparing the diseased and nondiseased with regard
to how frequently the attribute is present or, if quantitative, the levels of

population can be identified who are, have been, or in the future may be
exposed or not exposed, or exposed in different degrees, to a factor or factors
hypothesized to influence the probability of occurrence of a given disease
or other outcome. The main feature of cohort study is observation of large
numbers over a long period (commonly years) with comparison of incidence
rates in groups that differ in exposure levels. (CEBM website)

Compared with FDG-PET, patients diagnosed using NB incurred an expected incremental cost of $191 to obtain an additional 0.05 QALYs and resulted in an incremental cost- effectiveness ratio of $4,602 per additional QALY. Diagnosis by CT-FNA had a similar cost ($193) and efficacy with a QALY of 14.17 as compared with FDG-PET and marginally higher QALY (<0.01) when compared with NB. Diagnosis by VATS had both higher expected cost of $11,720 and a lower effectiveness (14.15 QALYs), and the other two biopsy strategies provided higher QALYs at a lower cost than VATS biopsy. Row
