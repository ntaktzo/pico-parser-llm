The quality of these studies was assessed by the NICE checklist. Shaw et al and Landi L. et al studies obtained a score of 8/8 and Maizieres et al. a score of 7/8 because of its retrospective nature. In both studies there was not information about the outcomes stratification 76% of the METROS study population received one prior line of therapy In Shaw A.T et al most of patients (89%) had received at least one previous line of standard therapy for advanced NSCLC and 42% of patients were Asian. In Mazières J et al. most of patients (80.7%) were stage IV and only one patient did not received a previous che
