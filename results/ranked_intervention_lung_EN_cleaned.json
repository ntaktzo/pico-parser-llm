of once-daily radiotherapy.
The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1,
because this is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the
recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in the section
on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer). However, there
was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this
is the same as the original 2011 recommendation.
There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent

e same as the original 2011 recommendation.
There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Because of the limited data, and the committee's experience that people prefer to
complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011 recommendation.
