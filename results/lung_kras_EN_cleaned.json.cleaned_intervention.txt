agreed that sotorasib was likely to extend life by over 3 months and
therefore meets the extension to life criterion. However, it noted that
there were uncertainties with the unanchored indirect treatment
comparison methods (see section 3.4). The committee concluded that
sotorasib may meet both end of life criteria, but the length of life
extension is uncertain.

taken as 8 tablets once a day compared with docetaxel that is
administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the
company assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities
for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged
that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company
identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1,
resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free
