Wu (2020) reported the outcome adverse events grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events. In the primary

Door inzet van durvalumab bedraagt het gemiddeld aantal LYG 6,12; bij actief volgen is dit 3,65. Het

beste 5-jaarsoverleving in de beste reeksen slechts circa 35 % bedraagt, is er veel interesse in behandelingen
die de prognose kunnen verbeteren.
Preklinisch zijn er sterke argumenten voor synergie of een additief effect tussen immunotherapie en
radiotherapie (Formenti, 2018; Ngwa, 2018). Daarom is het logisch om concurrente chemo-radiotherapie te
combineren met immunotherapie bij patiënten met stadium III NSCLC.

Bij patiënten in goede algehele conditie met thoracale klachten ten gevolge van longkanker kan (in overleg

ving, gezien voor patiënten met een gemetastaseerd NSCLC behandeld met nivolumab en ipilimumab met 2 cycli chemotherapie versus alleen chemotherapie. De meerwaarde van deze behandeling lijkt met name bij de groep met een afwezige PD-L1-expressie (PD-L1 < 1 procent) en/of co-mutaties die een kleiner effect op immuuntherapie voorspellen. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn KEAP1 en STK11, hoewel de precieze waarde hiervan nog aan onderzoek onderhevig is en er geen prospectief onderzoek naar deze specifieke co- mutaties is. Tevens heeft een directe vergelijking met chemo-immuuntherapie niet plaatsgevonden.|||

Tevens lijkt het erop dat co-mutaties in het tumorgenoom relevant kunnen zijn voor de keuze van eerstelijnsbehandeling bij EGFR-gemuteerd NSCLC. In de RELAY-studie werd het effect van TP53 comutaties op de behandeling van niet-behandelde, gemetastaseerde EGFR-gemuteerde NSCLC onderzocht. Hier bleek dat TP53 mutaties, vooral op exon 8, geassocieerd waren met slechtere PFS uitkomsten met erlotinib, maar niet met de combinatie van ramucirumab met erlotinib.|

international, multi-center phase III trial, with a minimum follow-up length of 61.3 months. They evaluated the
efficacy and safety of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab (plus chemotherapy if PD-L1 <1%)
