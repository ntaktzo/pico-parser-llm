There is evidence that surgical staging is useful when EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA are
negative but clinical suspicion of mediastinal malignancy is high. While there are potential
harms from the invasive nature of surgical staging, there is no evidence that these
outweigh the benefits in this population. Transthoracic needle biopsy, bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are no
longer recommended for staging lung cancer in intrathoracic lymph nodes because:
• bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are unlikely to reach the minimum
sensitivity required by the British Thoracic quality stan

who do have brain metastases often still have
radical lung treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA
NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of
people having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging in this population
are too low to justify the costs.
The 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of imaging after the
treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient
to conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committe

increase the number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this should
prevent the use of treatment options (such as lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some
patients for whom it is not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may also lead
to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and brain surgery. These
treatments would be expected to improve the person's prognosis, although each
