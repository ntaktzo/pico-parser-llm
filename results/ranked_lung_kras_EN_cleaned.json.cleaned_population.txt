platinum-doublet chemotherapy would be offered at disease

KRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the
company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival
are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and
KRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have
been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data.

The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a

Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more
comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little
difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also
noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain
metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains

considerable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to
docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative.
The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for
the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial
population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more
recent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial
uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis
using SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making.

that sotorasib could be considered an important treatment option for this

additional benefits associated with sotorasib that had not been captured
