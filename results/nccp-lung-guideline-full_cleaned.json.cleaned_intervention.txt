staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the management of solitary pulmonary nodules. Their
overall conclusion is that although the evidence appears mixed, it seems PET is either cost-saving or cost-
effective relative to other intervention strategies.
The analysis searched four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS EED, and the Cochrane Health Technology
Assessment Database) for literature on the cost-effectiveness of PET imaging. The authors assessed the

and CT-FNA. The cost-effectiveness ratio of NB relative to PET is reported as $4,600/QALY (€3,945/QALY in
2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). Accordingly, NB would be interpreted as a highly cost-effective
intervention as its ICER is well within commonly applied thresholds, such as the €45,000/QALY threshold
applied in Ireland. The NB strategy only provides 0.05 more QALYs than the baseline PET strategy and the

the differences in health related quality of life over a year following the operation. The procedures are
considered equivalent in terms of overall survival from cancer, so there are no long term differences

health effects was not applied because the differences in costs and effects of the procedures were only
assessed over a short time span. Similarly, no adjustment is made for inflation. The analysis does not

The study does not feature randomisation between the two interventions. While this may raise concerns
regarding the validity of the findings, it should also be noted that the study has demonstrated no
difference in a range of patient characteristics between the intervention groups. More relevant to issues
of external validity is the fact that the data for this study date from 2002 to 2004 and originate in the US,
so the findings might not necessarily be representative of current care in Ireland. Notably, the quality
of life measures employed failed to find a differenc

patient characteristics. Accordingly, the cost-effectiveness evidence presented in this study should be
disregarded.

Date: November 2017 Providing standardised clinical care to patients in healthcare is challenging. This is due to a number of
factors, among them variations in environments of care and complex patient presentations. It is self-
evident that safe, effective care and treatment are important in ensuring that patients get the best
outcomes from their care.
The Department of Health is of the view that supporting evidence-based practice, through the clinical
effectiveness framework, is a critical element of the health service to deliver safe and high quality care.
The Nation

can be delivered in a single session, usually requiring only a short admission. RFA is suitable for small
tumours, usually of 3 cm diameter or less, although larger lesions may be considered suitable in certain
circumstances. (Lim et al., 2010)

escalation to take place with the goal of increasing the biologically effective dose (BED) to a level to
achieve maximal tumour treatment with acceptable toxicity outcomes (De Ruysscher et al., 2012,
Machtay et al., 2012). Using isotoxic dose escalation, 4D planning in this study would allow, on average, an
additional increase in total dose by a factor of 1.19 compared with 3D planned dose escalation. For 55 Gy

than in the CT/ 3DCRT group. V was significantly higher in the 3DCRT group and was a significant factor
in determining toxicity. Freedom from DM was nearly identical in both groups. (Liao et al., 2010)
Treatment with 4DCT/IMRT was at least as good as that with 3DCRT in terms of the rates of freedom from
locoregional progression (LRP) and distant metastasis (DM). There was a significant reduction in toxicity
and a significant improvement in OS. (Liao et al., 2010) One study of low quality was identified tha

When planning radical radiotherapy to the thorax it is crucial to take into account the dose delivered
to the normal lung tissue, oesophagus, spinal cord and heart. In order to ensure the maximum sparing
of normal tissues, three-dimensional treatment planning is mandatory (Senan et al., 2004). However,
defining limits of dose tolerated by these tissues is complex as these limits vary according to the total dose
delivered, fractionation regimen and use of concurrent chemotherapy (Milano et al., 2007, Schultheiss et
al., 1995, van Baardwijk et al

ximum
(48 Gy). (Cole et al., 2014)
In addition to oesophageal dosimetry, the use of concurrent delivery of chemotherapy has been shown with already compromised respiratory function (Wang et al., 2002). This potentially life-threatening
complication is generally experienced in the first months after treatment. Established theoretical models
to predict the risk of pneumonitis include MLD or the volume of lung receiving more than a threshold
dose (e.g. V ) (Kwa et al., 1998, Fay et al., 2005). Predicted rates for lung toxicity in this group were 22%
less for the 4D group. When specific tumour and patient

constraints and dose volume histogram (DVH) characteristics, clinical factors may have a larger impact on
pneumonitis risks and outweigh any improvements that 4DCT may convey on an individual basis. (Cole et

survival of patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer and an R1 resection of the bronchial

(Liewald et al., 1992). The potential benefit of this treatment in terms of reduction of the risk of local

This review of the literature on the economic evaluation of the diagnosis, staging and treatment of
lung cancer and the budget impact analysis highlights potential economic consequences of the clinical
guideline recommendations. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) undertook a literature search for evidence of clinical- and cost-
effectiveness, cost and resource impact, including primary (res

ature review was undertaken using the same search terms as derived from the clinical literature
review (available as a separate document) but with an economic filter applied. The results of this
search were then refined by focusing on studies carried out in countries where the population, costs
and treatment were considered similar to the Irish setting. All papers included (Figure 9) were subject to
appraisal using the SIGN ‘Economic Evaluations: Methodology Checklist 6’ by a health economist and are
deemed of acceptable quality unless otherwise stated.

This analysis systematically reviewed four databases (MEDLINE, NIHR Centre for Reviews and

Overall this review does not appear to be of high quality. The unstructured reporting of results for many
treatment combinations and patient subgroups does not present the relevant evidence in an accessible
format. The lack of focus on any one particular therapy or patient subgroup means there is no clear
message to report to decision makers. Furthermore, the review does not appear to critically appraise

ing conventional versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for
surgically ineligible stage I NSCLC
Mitera et al. (2014) use a simple retrospective observational analysis to compare the costs and effects
of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the
treatment of stage I NSCLC. Their analysis indicates that SBRT is more costly and more effective than CFRT
and has a cost-effectiveness ratio well within standard cost-effectiveness thresholds.
The analysis compares stage Ia and Ib NSCLC patients receiving CFRT or SBRT instead of surgical resection.

YG). Accordingly, the low ICER estimate relative to commonly applied thresholds would suggest
SBRT is a highly cost-effective alternative to CFRT.
The results of this study cannot be considered reliable, as it is unclear if the relatively large survival benefit
of SBRT can be attributed to superior treatment effect or to differences in the patient characteristics
between those receiving CFRT and SBRT. The introduction to the review itself notes that no randomised
studies have demonstrated any difference between CFRT and SBRT. Furthermore, there are potentially
relevant differences between the patient g

ysis combines a retrospective analysis of high-risk patients receiving either surgery or SBRT with
a simulation model. The observed recurrence rates from the observational study were adjusted using
propensity score matching (PSM) with the aim of overcoming problems of selection bias between the
two treatment groups. Using data from the PSM analysis they model the costs and effects of the two
strategies. The effect estimates are not adjusted for quality of life, but rather are reported in life years

consideration to adverse effects associated with the SBRT therapy. The analysis includes a detailed costing
from the health payer perspective. The analysis also presents a range of sensitivity analyses.
The results show that RFA is the least costly and least effective treatment. 3D-CRT is more costly and
more effective, but subject to extended dominance, meaning it will never be a preferred strategy from
the cost-effectiveness perspective. SBRT is the most costly and most effective strategy. SBRT is estimated
to yield an incremental QALY gain of over half a QALY relative

ly than surgery in high-risk patients with early stage NSCLC.
However, surgery met the standard for cost-effectiveness due to a longer expected overall survival. This
is supported by recommendation 2.7.1.1.
The evidence also suggests that SBRT compared to 3D-CRT and RFA, was the most cost-effective treatment
for medically inoperable early stage NSCLC. This is also supported by recommendation 2.7.1.1.

Another reason for conclusions on cost-effectiveness to differ between countries relates to the prevailing
cost-effectiveness threshold. While Ireland has no explicit cost-effectiveness threshold for non-drug
interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios falling within the region of €45,000/QALY are conventionally
considered cost-effective in Ireland. As this threshold differs from the thresholds typically used in other

a) Benefit of histopathological analysis for SCLC and NSCLC
Lung cancer can be divided into many subtypes, the most important distinction is between SCLC and
NSCLC, this is important because of the major clinical differences in presentation, metastatic spread
and response to therapy. Another important feature of the pathology of lung cancer is histologic
heterogeneity, which consists of a mixture of histologic types that represents the derivation of lung
cancer from a pluripotent stem cell. (Travis, 2002) Immunohistochemistry should be used in all NSCLC cases which cannot be s

SBRT/SABR has led to improved population-based survival in elderly patients (Haasbeek et al., 2012), and
the convenience of this outpatient therapy over three to eight visits has also led to a reduction in the
proportion of untreated patients. The SBRT/SABR dose should be to a biologically equivalent tumour dose
of ≥100 Gy, prescribed to the encompassing isodose. (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013)

Overall this review does not appear to be of high quality. The unstructured reporting of results for many
treatment combinations and patient subgroups does not present the relevant evidence in an accessible

message to report to decision makers. Furthermore, the review does not appear to critically appraise

significant reduction in the total incidence of brain metastases was observed after higher-dose PCI, but
there was a significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25 Gy should remain the standard of care in limited-
stage SCLC. (Le Pechoux et al., 2009) Pignon et al. (1992) performed a meta-analysis of thoracic RT for SCLC. It included 13 trials comparing

with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, with a small incremental risk of oesophageal toxicity. Future
