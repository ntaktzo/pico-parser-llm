When the analyses were limited to patients with clinical stage Ia 3-year disease-free survival did not differ
significantly between the SBRT/SABR (n = 57) and surgery (n = 288) patients, but the surgery patients
achieved significantly higher rates of local control at 3 years compared to the SBRT/SABR patients.
