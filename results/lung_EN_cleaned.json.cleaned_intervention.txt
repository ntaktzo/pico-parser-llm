be a preferable option for many people with lung cancer. There are also various factors
that may make SABR less costly than surgery. For example, it is usually delivered as
outpatient treatment. There might also be subgroups for whom different forms of surgery
or SABR might be the most cost-effective options. The committee made a
recommendation for research on SABR compared with surgery to investigate these
uncertainties. The new recommendations on SABR are a change from the 2011 guidelin

First-line treatment for limited-stage disease

will not be well enough to tolerate twice-daily

of once-daily radiotherapy.
The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1,
because this is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the
recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in the section
on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer). However, there
was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this
is the same as the original 2011 recommendation.

There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Because of the limited data, and the committee's experience that people prefer to
complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011 recommendation.

Lung cancer has 2 main types:
• non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is more common and spreads more slowly
• small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is rarer and spreads more quickly.
Treatment depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer, and the person's
health. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery,
supportive care cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and ablation.

Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that only 72% of
people have pathological confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in
the availability of molecular testing in lung cancer diagnosis.
NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as improve access
to and uptake of radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely
used for certain subgroups of people with early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of
licensed immunotherapies and biological targeted therapies for treating advanced NSCLC,

Chemoradiotherapy with surgery is not often offered in current practice. In addition, there
are specific factors to take into account when offering all these treatments together.
Therefore, multidisciplinary teams providing it should have expertise both in the combined
therapy, and in all the individual components.
Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a variety of NSCLC indications but there
is currently no evidence on whether it is clinically or cost effective for people with stage
IIIA-N2 NSCLC following surgery. The committee made a recommendation for resea

lable on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Because of the limited data, and the committee's experience that people prefer to
complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011 recommendation.

July 2023: We have made the following changes to the systemic anti-cancer therapy
treatment pathways for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer:
• added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on dabrafenib and trametinib, for
squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
• added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on mobocertinib, for non-squamous
non-small-cell lung canc
