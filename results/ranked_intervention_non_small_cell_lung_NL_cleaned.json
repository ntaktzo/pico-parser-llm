s (NEJ009 and the Beverly study) reported the effect of first generation TKI + other treatment versus first generation TKI on OS. Treatment with first generation TKI + other treatment resulted in a longer OS compared to treatment with first generation TKI. The absolute differences in OS between the intervention and control group was 5% in the NEJ009 trial after 5 years and 5% in the Beverly study after a median follow up of 36.3 months. The pooled HR is 0.79 (95%CI 0.64; 0.99) favoring treatment with first generation TKI+other treatment. This difference was not considered clinically relevant.||
