0.94-1.06; p=0.97). The study concluded that in patients with advanced NSCLC a second drug improved
tumour response and survival rate and that adding a third drug had a weaker effect on tumour response
and no effect on survival.

SBRT over 3D-CRT was $6,000/quality- adjusted life-year, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for SBRT over RFA was $14,100/quality- adjusted life-year. One- way sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust across a range of tumour sizes, patient utility values, and costs. This result was confirmed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses that varied local control rates and utilities. Row 1: |Intervention Row 1: n|Ana Row 1: |Clinical & QALY Outcomes|Costs

increase in median overall survival from 5.4 to 6.7 months after randomisation. The 1-year survival rate
was 27.1% in the PCI group and 13.3% in the control group (p=0.003). PCI had side effects but did not
have a clinically significant effect on global health status. The largest mean difference between the two
arms was observed in fatigue and hair loss, which were greater in those who received PCI (Slotman et
al., 2009). PCI reduced the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolonged overall survival in

radiotherapy versus surgery alone. Data on 2128 patients from nine randomised trials (published and
unpublished) were analysed by intention to treat. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (2.3–9.8 for individual
trials) for surviving patients. The results show a significant adverse effect of postoperative radiotherapy
on survival (HR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08–1.34]). Subgroup analyses suggest that this adverse effect was greatest
for patients with stage I/II, N0–N1 disease, whereas for those with stage III, N2 disease there was no clear
evidence of an adverse effect. The authors concluded t
