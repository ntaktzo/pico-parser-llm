The National Cancer Control Programme engages regularly with the individual cancer centres and with Hospital Group
structures. Discussion of performance data, improvement plans, resources including manpower, service planning and
development takes place at regular review meetings between the NCCP and senior management at cancer centre and Hospital
Group level. It is important that both the implementation of the guideline and patient outcomes are audited to ensure
that this guideline positively impacts on patient care. For audit criteria see Appendix 8: Audit criteria and
monitoring. Clinical trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation and other local therapies
in patients with early stage NSCLC who are high risk surgery candidates. (CQ 2.2.3) The role of imaging surveillance in
patients with NSCLC treated with curative intent needs to be elucidated. (CQ 2.2.4) The role of MRI in staging patients
with negative clinical evaluation findings has not been adequately studied. (CQ 2.2.6) Membership of the Guideline

central lesions (see Table 3 and Table 4). Fluoroscopy may improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in sampling
peripheral lesions but diagnostic yield remains lower than percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (Detterbeck

negative predicted probability (93% vs 86%) than surgical staging alone (Sharples et al., 2012). The technique is
associated with low risk and less need for general anaesthesia and thoracotomy. The use of these techniques readily
allows for repeat sampling of the mediastinum which is simpler than repeat mediastinoscopy (Yasufuku et al., 2011).
(SIGN, 2014) The indications for cervical mediastinoscopy have evolved with the increasing availability of PET, EBUS,
EUS and broader selection criteria for surgery. With a sensitivity of 85% for PET imaging, many consider that
confirmatory mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsies are not required following a ‘negative’ PET. Microscopic N2 disease
may have a better prognosis, but this will only be confirmed if appropriate followed by mediastinoscopy is indicated to

isease had a 5-year survival of 52% compared with 0% for patients with mediastinal nodal disease (p=0.008). Survival of
patients who underwent adrenalectomy for synchronous and metachronous adrenal metastases was not significantly different
(p=0.81). Surgical resection of isolated adrenal metastasis from lung cancer provides a survival benefit in well-
selected patients compared with nonoperative management. No patient with contralateral adrenal metastases or mediastinal
nodal disease survived long term after adrenalectomy. The time interval between treatment of the primary lung cancer and
adrenal metastasis was not significantly associated with survival, but the cohort size was small. In patients with an
isolated brain metastasis and a synchronous resectable primary NSCLC, sequential resection of the primary tumour and
definitive treatment of the brain metastasis C may be considered, following discussion at a multidisciplinary team
meeting. In patients with an isolated adrenal metastasis and a synchronous resectable primary NSCLC, sequential
resection of the primary tumour and definitive treatment of the adrenal D metastasis may be considered, following
discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. The management of these patients should be discussed at a
multidisciplinary team meeting including the role of systemic therapy. Should surgical resection be considered as part
of the multimodality treatment of patients with stage Two clinical guidelines (Lim et al., 2010, SIGN, 2014) addressed
this clinical question. N2 disease describes any metastatic involvement of ipsilateral or subcarinal mediastinal nodes.
This term encompasses a spectrum of disease from micrometastatic disease in one node to extranodal extension from
malignant disease in several lymph node stations and therefore the management of N2 disease should take this into
consideration. (Lim et al., 2010) more influence on prognosis than anatomical site of lymph node involvement (Rusch et
al., 2007); hence nodal stations are now consolidated into lymph node zones (Rusch et al., 2009). The prognosis of
single zone N2 disease (N2a) was better than multi-zone N2 (N2b) disease with post-resection 5-year survivals of 34% and
20%, respectively (p<0.001) (Rusch et al., 2007). (Lim et al., 2010) Resection may be considered in patients with single
zone N2 disease as survival is similar to patients with multi-zone N1b disease (Rusch et al., 2007). (Lim et al., 2010)
Patients with bulky or fixed N2 disease are not considered for surgery and are treated by combinations of chemotherapy,
radical radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. (Lim et al., 2010) A number of retrospective case series with
relatively small numbers (30–100 cases) have been published detailing the clinical outcomes achieved following surgery
in selected patients with stage IIIa disease (Detterbeck, 2001). Patients were managed using a multimodality approach
that included preoperative chemotherapy and occasionally radiotherapy. Most studies suggested a survival benefit with a
chemotherapy plus surgical resection protocol, compared with contemporary non-surgical management. (SIGN, 2014) Patients
who are suitable for surgery should have non-fixed, non-bulky disease and should be expected to tolerate multimodality
treatment (Lim et

regular review meetings between the NCCP and senior management at cancer centre and Hospital Group level. It is
important that both the implementation of the guideline and patient outcomes are audited to ensure that this guideline
positively impacts on patient care. For audit criteria see Appendix 8: Audit criteria and monitoring. Clinical trials
are needed to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation and other local therapies in patients with early
stage NSCLC who are high risk surgery candidates. (CQ 2.2.3) The role of imaging surveillance in patients with NSCLC
treated with curative intent needs to be elucidated. (CQ 2.2.4) The role of MRI in staging patients with negative
clinical evaluation findings has not been adequately studied. (CQ 2.2.6) Membership of the Guideline Development Group

is recommended. The addition of a third cytotoxic chemo-therapeutic agent is not recommended because it provides no
survival benefit and may be harmful. Effectiveness of first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy In patients receiving palliative

y team (MDT) is responsible for the implementation of the guideline recommendations. A summary of tools to assist in the
implementation of this National Clinical Guideline are available in Appendix 3: Summary of the tools to assist in the
implementation of the National Clinical Guideline. The National Cancer Control Programme engages regularly with the
individual cancer centres and with Hospital Group structures. Discussion of performance data, improvement plans,
resources including manpower, service planning and development takes place at regular review meetings between the NCCP
and senior management at cancer centre and Hospital Group level. It is important that both the implementation of the
guideline and patient outcomes are audited to ensure that this guideline positively impacts on patient care. For audit
criteria see Appendix 8: Audit criteria and monitoring. Clinical trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of
radiofrequency ablation and other local therapies in patients with early stage NSCLC who are high risk surgery
candidates. (CQ 2.2.3) The role of imaging surveillance in patients with NSCLC treated with curative intent needs to be
elucidated. (CQ 2.2.4) The role of MRI in staging patients with negative clinical evaluation findings has not been

rapy regimen is of initial chemotherapy. Single agent chemotherapy should be considered in patients with primary
refractory SCLC to maintain or improve quality of life. Responsibility for the implementation of radiation oncology
recommendations While the CEO, General Manager and the Clinical Director of the hospital have corporate responsibility
for the implementation of the recommendations in this National Clinical Guideline, each member of the multidisciplinary
team is responsible for the implementation of the individual guideline recommendations relevant to their discipline. The
literature used in the development of this guideline was based on the 7th edition of the Lung Cancer TNM staging system.
The 8th edition of the TNM staging system was published in December In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
early stage disease (T1-T2 N0 M0) who are unfit for surgery, what is the effectiveness of stereotactic radiotherapy,
standard radical radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation? Two clinical guidelines (NICE, 2011, Vansteenkiste et al.,
2013) and a retrospective study (Ambrogi et al., 2015) addressed this clinical question. Crabtree et al. (2010) found
that among their group of patients with clinical stage I NSCLC significantly more patients who had received surgical
treatment were alive at 3 years than patients who had received SBRT/SABR. The treatment groups did not differ in terms
of 3-year cancer-specific survival or local control. When the analyses were limited to patients with clinical stage Ia
3-year disease-free survival did not differ significantly between the SBRT/SABR (n = 57) and surgery (n = 288) patients,
but the surgery patients achieved significantly higher rates of local control at 3 years compared to the SBRT/SABR
patients. Analysis of the patients with clinical stage Ib found no differences in 3-year disease-free survival or local
control between the SBRT/SABR (n = 19) and surgery (n = 174) patients. In a separate series of analyses the authors
attempted to address the baseline differences between the treatment groups in terms of age, clinical T stage,
comorbidities and % predicted FEV and D by matching surgery patients to the SBRT/ SABR patients. Subsequent matched-
patient analyses revealed no differences between the groups in terms of overall survival, disease-specific survival, or
local control. No treatment-related deaths occurred as a consequence of SBRT although some other complications were
associated with the treatment. In the surgery group, the operative mortality rate was 15/462 patients and 179/462
patients experienced complications associated with the surgical treatment. (NICE, 2011) Grills et al. (2010) reported
that rates of freedom from any failure, causes-specific survival, distant metastasis and local, regional, and loco-
regional recurrence did not differ significantly between patients with stage I NSCLC who had received treatment with
either SBRT/SABR or wedge resection, but the overall survival rate was significantly higher in the surgery patients than
in those patients who had received SBRT/SABR. A second set of analyses excluding patients with pT4, synchronous primary
or no biopsy revealed similar results with the exception of the loco-regional occurrence rate which was now
significantly higher i

than in those patients who had received SBRT/SABR. A second set of analyses excluding patients with pT4, synchronous
primary or no biopsy revealed similar results with the exception of the loco-regional occurrence rate which was now
significantly higher in the patients who had received surgery. Multivariate analyses showed that in the patients who had
received SBRT/SABR squamous histology and the presence of synchronous primary tumour were significant predictors of
distant metastasis and in the patients who had received wedge resection, visceral pleural invasion and stage Ib were
significant predictors of distant metastasis. In addition, in all patients, age > 71 years was a significant predictor
of overall survival. No treatment- related deaths were observed as a consequence of either treatment, but a number of
adverse events were associated with both treatments. (NICE, 2011) In patients unfit for surgery, SBRT/SABR is the
treatment of choice for peripherally located stage I NSCLC (if SBRT/SABR is not available, a hypofractionated
radiotherapy schedule with a high biologically equivalent dose is advised). (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013) SBRT/SABR has
led to improved population-based survival in elderly patients (Haasbeek et al., 2012), and the convenience of this
outpatient therapy over three to eight visits has also led to a reduction in the proportion of untreated patients. The
SBRT/SABR dose should be to a biologically equivalent tumour dose of ≥100 Gy, prescribed to the encompassing isodose.

, 0.84 to 1.05). However, in patients with adenocarcinoma randomly assigned to cisplatin/ pemetrexed, survival was
significantly better than for those assigned to cisplatin/gemcitabine (12.6 v 10.9 months, respectively; p=0.03). This
is supported by a recent meta-analysis (Pilkington et al., 2015) that combined the results from Scalgliotti et al.
(2009) and Gronberg et al. (2009) and found that in patients with non-squamous disease, there is evidence that
pemetrexed+platinum increases OS compared with gemcitabine+platinum (MA: HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; MTC-1: HR 0.85,
95% CI 0.74 to 0.98). A number of phase II/III trials (Johnson et al., 2004, Sandler et al., 2006, Reck et al., 2009,
Herbst et al., 2007, Niho et al., 2012) looked at the addition of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy.
Additionally, four meta-analyses (Soria et al., 2013, Botrel et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2012, Lima et al., 2011) have
addressed this issue, they broadly agree that the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC improves OS, PFS and RR. However, the absolute benefits are small and the adverse effects of treatment are
considerable. A Cochrane review (Greenhalgh et al., 2016) and a phase III trial (Solomon et al., 2014) addressed the
effectiveness of first-line targeted therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The Guideline Development Group
highlighted this as a rapidly evolving area of research. with cytotoxic chemotherapy (used alone or in combination) and
best supportive care. The study found an increased tumour response rate and prolonged progression-free survival compared
to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Intervention Control Relative effect (95% CI) Overall Survival PFS Erlotinib vs. Cytotoxic

HR 0.39 (0.32 to 0.48) Afatinib vs. Cytotoxic chemotherapy HR 0.93 (0.74 to 1.17) HR 0.42 (0.34 to 0.53) Adapted from
(Greenhalgh et al., 2016) Greenhalgh et al. (2016) concluded that erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib are effective in
prolongation closely linked, and the available data would favour selection of TKIs over chemotherapy as first-line
treatment based on both these criteria. The review included six trials that measured quality of life for cytotoxic
chemotherapy, two comparing erlotinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and two comparing gefitinib with cytotoxic
chemotherapy); all six trials reported a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. All three TKIs
showed symptom palliation of cough, pain, and dyspnoea, although the methodology used was not standardised. The majority
of trials included people with a performance status (PS) of 1 and 2, but the data on AEs suggest that some PS 3 as well
as elderly patients might tolerate the agents better than cytotoxic chemotherapy (Chen et al., 2012, Reck et al., 2010).
Solomon et al. (2014) conducted an open-label, phase III trial comparing crizotinib treatment with NSCLC. Progression-
free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib than with chemotherapy (median, 10.9 months vs. 7.0 months;
hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.60; p<0.001).

randomly assigned to a standard (n=360, 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or higher PCI total dose (n=360, 36 Gy)
delivered using either conventional (18 daily fractions of 2 Gy) or accelerated hyperfractionated (24 fractions in 16
days with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy separated by a minimum interval of 6 h) radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of
39 months (range 0–89 months), 145 patients had brain metastases; 82 in the standard-dose group and 63 in the higher-
dose group. There was no significant difference in the 2-year incidence of brain metastases between the standard PCI
dose group and the higher-dose group, at 29% (95% CI 24–35) and 23% (18–29), respectively (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.57–1.11],
p=0.18). Two hundred and twenty six patients in the standard-dose group and 252 in the higher-dose group died; 2-year
overall survival was 42% (95% CI 37–48) in the standard-dose group and 37% (32–42) in the higher-dose group (HR 1.20
[1.00–1.44]; p=0.05). The authors concluded that no significant reduction in the total incidence of brain metastases was
observed after higher-dose PCI, but there was a significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25 Gy should remain the
standard of care in limited- stage SCLC. (Le Pechoux et al., 2009) Pignon et al. (1992) performed a meta-analysis of
thoracic RT for SCLC. It included 13 trials comparing chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy and thoracic RT totalling 2,140
patients, of which 433 were excluded as they had extensive disease. 1,862 of the 2,103 patients who could be evaluated
died; the median follow-up of the surviving patients was 43 months. The relative risk of death in the combined therapy
group compared to the chemotherapy group was 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94; p=0.001). There was a 5.4% benefit in terms of
overall survival at three years for the combined therapy group. The authors concluded that thoracic RT moderately
improves survival in patients with limited SCLC who are treated with combination chemotherapy. There is controversy
regarding the optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy, with some meta-analysis suggesting a small OS benefit of early
delivery concomitantly to chemotherapy. However, this is associated with an increase in treatment related toxicity (Lu
et al., 2014, Spiro et al., 2006, Pijls-Johannesma et al., Slotman et al., (2007) conducted a randomised trial (European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 08993-22993) of PCI in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung
cancer who had had any degree of response to chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo PCI or to receive
no further therapy. The primary end point was the time to symptomatic brain metastases. CT scanning or MRI of the brain
was performed when any predefined key symptom suggestive of brain metastases was present, but was not done routinely
prior to PCI. The two groups (each with 143 patients) were well balanced regarding baseline characteristics. The
cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was 14.6% in the PCI group and 40.4% in the control group (HR 0.27;
p<0.001). PCI was associated with an increase in median overall survival from 5.4 to 6.7 months after randomisation. The

dies, the median survival for the curative intent groups (bifocal therapy ± adjuvant treatment) ranged from 19 to 27
months (mean=23.12±3.3 months) and at 1, 2 and 5 years from 56% to 69% (mean= 63.9±5.6%), 28% to 54% (mean= 38.7±11%)
and 11% to 24% (mean=18±5.7%), respectively. In comparison, the median and 1-year survival of the palliative groups were
7.1–12.9 months (mean=10.3±2.9 months) and 33–39.7% (mean= 35.3±3.8%), respectively. The study concluded that in the
absence of mediastinal lymph node involvement, surgical resection of NSCLC with complete resection of the brain
metastasis improves prognosis. Raz et al. (2011) identified 37 patients with isolated adrenal metastasis from NSCLC.
Twenty patients underwent adrenalectomy. Patients did not undergo adrenalectomy owing to suspicion of N2 disease,
medical comorbidities, or patient preference. Seven patients (35%) treated surgically had tumours that were ipsilateral
to their primary tumour, and eight (40%) had metachronous metastases. Five-year overall survival was 34% for patients
treated operatively and 0% for patients treated nonoperatively p=0.002). Among patients treated with adrenalectomy,
patients with ipsilateral metastases had a 5-year survival of 83% compared with 0% for patients with contralateral
metastases (p=0.003). Patients without mediastinal nodal disease had a 5-year survival of 52% compared with 0% for
patients with mediastinal nodal disease (p=0.008). Survival of patients who underwent adrenalectomy for synchronous and
metachronous adrenal metastases was not significantly different (p=0.81). Surgical resection of isolated adrenal
metastasis from lung cancer provides a survival benefit in well-selected patients compared with nonoperative management.
No patient with contralateral adrenal metastases or mediastinal nodal disease survived long term after adrenalectomy.
The time interval between treatment of the primary lung cancer and adrenal metastasis was not significantly associated
with survival, but the cohort size was small. In patients with an isolated brain metastasis and a synchronous resectable
primary NSCLC, sequential resection of the primary tumour and definitive treatment of the brain metastasis C may be
considered, following discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. In patients with an isolated adrenal metastasis
and a synchronous resectable primary NSCLC, sequential resection of the primary tumour and definitive treatment of the
adrenal D metastasis may be considered, following discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. The management of
these patients should be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting including the role of systemic therapy. Should
surgical resection be considered as part of the multimodality treatment of patients with stage Two clinical guidelines
(Lim et al., 2010, SIGN, 2014) addressed this clinical question. N2 disease describes any metastatic involvement of
ipsilateral or subcarinal mediastinal nodes. This term encompasses a spectrum of disease from micrometastatic disease in
one node to extranodal extension from malignant disease in several lymph node stations and therefore the management of
N2 disease should take this into consideration. (Lim et al., 2010) more influence on prognosis than anatomical site of
