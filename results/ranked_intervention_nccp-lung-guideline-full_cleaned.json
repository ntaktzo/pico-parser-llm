LC NOS. (NCCN, V8 2017) A recent Cochrane review (Santos et al., 2015) aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of different
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for previously untreated elderly patients with advanced (stage IIIb
and IV) NSCLC. The study included 51 trials: non-platinum single-agent therapy versus non-platinum
combination therapy (seven trials) and non-platinum combination therapy versus platinum combination
therapy (44 trials). The reviews results were as follows:

Median PFS in the erlotinib group was 6.3 weeks (95% CI 6.1–6.9) versus 8.6 weeks (7.1–12.1) in the chemotherapy group. There was no statistically significant difference in PFS between the two treatment groups (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.97–1.46; p=0.089).

chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy and thoracic RT totalling 2,140 patients, of which 433 were
excluded as they had extensive disease. 1,862 of the 2,103 patients who could be evaluated died; the
median follow-up of the surviving patients was 43 months. The relative risk of death in the combined
therapy group compared to the chemotherapy group was 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94; p=0.001). There was
a 5.4% benefit in terms of overall survival at three years for the combined therapy group. The authors
concluded that thoracic RT moderately improves survival in patients with limited SCLC who are treated
