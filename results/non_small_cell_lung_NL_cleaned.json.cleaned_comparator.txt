In patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1%, the median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months (95% CI:

group. As the median overall survival in the control group was <12 months, the clinical relevance of PFS was
not considered.
In the 2-year update, the median PFS in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1% was 5.8 months (95%

favor of the dual immunotherapy group. As the median overall survival in the control group was <12 months,
the clinical relevance of PFS was not considered.
The 2023 ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an PFS rate of 12% for the dual

* The PD-L1 status was quantifiable for 338 out of 361 patients (94%) in the dual immunotherapy group, and
in 333 out of 358 patients (93%) in the control group.
PD-L1 expression on viable tumour cells was assessed with immunohistochemical 28-8 pharmDx assay (Paz-

Vanuit de overlevingsdata komt naar voren dat de patiënten in de studie die behandeld werden met
osimertinib een overlevingsvoordeel hadden t.o.v. placebo. Alhoewel osimertinib ook gegeven zou kunnen
worden bij progressie van ziekte, lijkt het er dus op dat na een vroege interventie overlevingswinst optreedt.

Daarnaast is het voorkómen van ziekte progressie met bijkomende klachten ook relevant. Zo is het voorkómen van hersenmetastasen een belangrijke

ival de data nog niet matuur was. Bij de IMpower150 studie (Socinski, 2018) werd in de groep met negatieve PD-L1 expressie op zowel tumorcellen als immuuncellen wel een statistisch significant voordeel gezien voor de groep die met de atezolizumab-combinatie behandeld werd versus de groep die met de placebo-combinatie behandeld werd. De hazard ratio voor progressie of overlijden bedroeg voor deze groep echter 0,77 (95% BI 0,61 tot 0,99), wat niet voldoet aan de door de werkgroep vooraf gedefinieerde criteria voor een klinisch relevant verschil. Desondanks is de werkgroep van mening dat ook bij deze su
