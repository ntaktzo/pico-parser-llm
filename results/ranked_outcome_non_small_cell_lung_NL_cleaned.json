Overall survival - Critical outcome
Two of the two included studies reported on overall survival (OS).
De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on OS as secondary endpoint. The study
was not powered for OS. Treatment with sotorasib resulted in similar OS compared to treatment with
