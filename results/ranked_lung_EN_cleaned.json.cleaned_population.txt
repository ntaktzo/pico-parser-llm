of lung cancers are preventable, with 86% of these linked to smoking, 13% to occupational
exposure, 9% to dietary factors and 7.8% to air pollution. Lung cancer can be linked to
more than one cause.

There is evidence that surgical staging is useful when EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA are
negative but clinical suspicion of mediastinal malignancy is high. While there are potential
harms from the invasive nature of surgical staging, there is no evidence that these
outweigh the benefits in this population. Transthoracic needle biopsy, bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are no
longer recommended for staging lung cancer in intrathoracic lymph nodes because:
• bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are unlikely to reach the minimum
sensitivity required by the British Thoracic quality stan

who do have brain metastases often still have
radical lung treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA
NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of
people having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging in this population
are too low to justify the costs.
The 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of imaging after the
treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient
to conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committe

ns in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in

increase the number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this should
prevent the use of treatment options (such as lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some
patients for whom it is not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may also lead
to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and brain surgery. These
treatments would be expected to improve the person's prognosis, although each
treatment would carry its own risks and side effec
