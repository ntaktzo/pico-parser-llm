atment (depending on factors such as the number of metastases, prognosis and patient preference), and this reduces
costs. In people with clinical stage I NSCLC and no neurological symptoms, the prevalence of detectable brain metastases
is fairly low (around 4%) compared with people with stage II or IIIA disease. People with stage I NSCLC who do have
brain metastases often still have radical lung treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA
NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of people having radical treatment
mean that the benefits of brain imaging in this population are too low to justify the costs. The 2018 review only
examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of imaging after the treatment plan has been decided, but the committee
noted that it could be more efficient to conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the
committee made a recommendation for research on routine brain imaging with CT at initial diagnosis and/or staging. ©

estimated that the recommendations will increase the number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this
should prevent the use of treatment options (such as lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some patients for whom it is
not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may also lead to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic
radiosurgery and brain surgery. These treatments would be expected to improve the person's prognosis, although each
treatment would carry its own risks and side effects. Return to recommendations Surgery and radiotherapy with curative
intent for non-small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.6.1 and 1.6.5 to 1.6.12 For people with non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who are well enough and for whom treatment with curative intent is suitable, the evidence showed that
lobectomy provides better survival outcomes than stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Lobectomy is a good
compromise between preserving pulmonary function and being more likely to remove cancerous cells compared with sublobar
resection. For people with stage I–IIA (T1a–T2b, N0, M0) NSCLC, the evidence showed that: • if they decline lobectomy or
it is contraindicated, sublobar resection and SABR both provide better survival outcomes than conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy, although it is not clear which of these 2 is better • if they decline any surgery or it is
contraindicated, SABR provides better survival outcomes than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, and people often
prefer it because it involves fewer hospital visits • if surgery and SABR are contraindicated, conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy provides better survival outcomes than no radiotherapy. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

who decline it, the evidence was not strong enough to recommend conventional radiotherapy over hyper-fractionated

urgery is not often offered in current practice. In addition, there are specific factors to take into account when
offering all these treatments together. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams providing it should have expertise both in
the combined therapy, and in all the individual components. Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a variety of
NSCLC indications but there is currently no evidence on whether it is clinically or cost effective for people with stage
IIIA-N2 NSCLC following surgery. The committee made a recommendation for research on immunotherapy after multimodality
treatment to address this. The committee felt that chemoradiotherapy and surgery is offered far less often than
chemoradiotherapy alone or chemotherapy and surgery for people with NSCLC stage IIIA- N2. Therefore, these
recommendations could lead to a change in current practice. Return to recommendations © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5 The evidence showed a survival benefit from twice-daily radiotherapy compared with
once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people with small-cell lung cancer will not be well enough to
tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving people the option of once-daily radiotherapy. The
committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1, because this is when planning
for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy
in the section on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer). However, there was no new
evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this is the same as the original 2011
recommendation. There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy was
more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because of the limited data, and the committee's
experience that people prefer to complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011
recommendation. Return to recommendations Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung
cancer Recommendations 1.12.3 and 1.12.4 © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 43 There
was some uncertainty in the evidence. However, the study most relevant to UK practice showed that thoracic radiotherapy
improves long-term survival for people who have had a partial or complete response to chemotherapy, if they live longer
than 1 year after the radiotherapy. The committee specified that thoracic radiotherapy should be given alongside
prophylactic cranial irradiation. This is to match recommendation 1.4.55. In addition, the reviewed clinical trials gave
thoracic radiotherapy alongside prophylactic cranial irradiation. The evidence showed that prophylactic cranial
irradiation improves survival versus best supportive care. are limited. There is also some evidence from a study outside

e.org. .uk/ter rms-a and- Page 45 of 51 Over 46,000 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK in 2015. An
estimated 89% of lung cancers are preventable, with 86% of these linked to smoking, 13% to occupational exposure, 9% to
dietary factors and 7.8% to air pollution. Lung cancer can be linked to more than one cause. In 2015 in the UK, over
35,000 people died from lung cancer. The overall mortality rate from lung cancer has decreased by 9% over the last
decade. However, while there has been a decrease of 19% in mortality rates in men, there has been an increase of 2% in
women. This is linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and is driven by an increased incidence of lung cancer in
older women. In the UK, lung cancer is more common in people of European family origin than in people of African or
Asian family origin. It is strongly linked to socioeconomic deprivation. There are many risk factors for lung cancer,
including age, genetics, lifestyle (especially smoking) and occupation. Lung cancer is estimated to cost the UK economy
£2.4 billion per year. Note: all statistics in this section are from Cancer Research UK's Lung Cancer Statistics. Lung
cancer is diagnosed and staged using a variety of tests, including chest X-rays, CT or positron-emission tomography CT
(PET-CT). Lung cancer samples are commonly acquired for diagnosis using bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or
a percutaneous procedure (guided by CT or ultrasound). Lung cancer has 2 main types: • non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), which is more common and spreads more slowly • small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is rarer and spreads more
quickly. Treatment depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer, and the person's health. Possible
treatments include radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery, supportive care cryotherapy, photodynamic
therapy and ablation. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 46 Since 2011, when the NICE
lung cancer guideline was last updated, there have been changes in the way that lung cancer is diagnosed and treated.
The Royal College of Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that only 72% of people have
pathological confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in the availability of molecular testing in
lung cancer diagnosis. NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as improve access to and
uptake of radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely used for certain subgroups of people
with early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of licensed immunotherapies and biological targeted therapies for
treating advanced NSCLC, and NICE has published technology appraisals covering many of these. © NICE 2024. All rights

in the UK in 2015. An estimated 89% of lung cancers are preventable, with 86% of these linked to smoking, 13% to
occupational exposure, 9% to dietary factors and 7.8% to air pollution. Lung cancer can be linked to more than one
cause. In 2015 in the UK, over 35,000 people died from lung cancer. The overall mortality rate from lung cancer has
decreased by 9% over the last decade. However, while there has been a decrease of 19% in mortality rates in men, there
has been an increase of 2% in women. This is linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and is driven by an increased
incidence of lung cancer in older women. In the UK, lung cancer is more common in people of European family origin than
in people of African or Asian family origin. It is strongly linked to socioeconomic deprivation. There are many risk
factors for lung cancer, including age, genetics, lifestyle (especially smoking) and occupation. Lung cancer is
estimated to cost the UK economy £2.4 billion per year. Note: all statistics in this section are from Cancer Research
UK's Lung Cancer Statistics. Lung cancer is diagnosed and staged using a variety of tests, including chest X-rays, CT or
positron-emission tomography CT (PET-CT). Lung cancer samples are commonly acquired for diagnosis using bronchoscopy,
endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or a percutaneous procedure (guided by CT or ultrasound). Lung cancer has 2 main types:
• non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is more common and spreads more slowly • small-cell lung cancer (SCLC),
which is rarer and spreads more quickly. Treatment depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer, and the
person's health. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery, supportive care
cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and ablation. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 46
Since 2011, when the NICE lung cancer guideline was last updated, there have been changes in the way that lung cancer is
diagnosed and treated. The Royal College of Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that
only 72% of people have pathological confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in the availability
of molecular testing in lung cancer diagnosis. NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as
improve access to and uptake of radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely used for
certain subgroups of people with early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of licensed immunotherapies and biological
targeted therapies for treating advanced NSCLC, and NICE has published technology appraisals covering many of these. ©

2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 38 Brain imaging for people having treatment with curative
intent Recommendations 1.3.23 to 1.3.25 Brain imaging is helpful before starting treatment with curative intent, because
if brain metastases are detected then the treatment plan is likely to change. However, routine brain imaging is
expensive, and the evidence showed that it does not always offer a good balance of benefits and costs. In people with
stage II and IIIA disease, the benefits of brain imaging outweigh the costs because: • brain metastases are more common
than in stage I disease • people can start early treatment for metastases if they are identified, which improves
prognosis • some people with brain metastases will not have radical treatment (depending on factors such as the number
of metastases, prognosis and patient preference), and this reduces costs. In people with clinical stage I NSCLC and no
neurological symptoms, the prevalence of detectable brain metastases is fairly low (around 4%) compared with people with
stage II or IIIA disease. People with stage I NSCLC who do have brain metastases often still have radical lung
treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of
metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of people having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging
in this population are too low to justify the costs. The 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness
of imaging after the treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient to conduct
CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committee made a recommendation for research on
routine brain imaging with CT at initial diagnosis and/or staging. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice

number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this should prevent the use of treatment options (such as
lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some patients for whom it is not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may
also lead to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and brain surgery. These treatments would be

recommendations could lead to a change in current practice. Return to recommendations © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5 The evidence showed a survival benefit from twice-daily radiotherapy compared with
once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people with small-cell lung cancer will not be well enough to
tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving people the option of once-daily radiotherapy. The
committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1, because this is when planning
for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy
in the section on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer). However, there was no new
evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this is the same as the original 2011
recommendation. There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy was
more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because of the limited data, and the committee's
experience that people prefer to complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011
recommendation. Return to recommendations Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung

improves long-term survival for people who have had a partial or complete response to chemotherapy, if they live longer
than 1 year after the radiotherapy. The committee specified that thoracic radiotherapy should be given alongside
prophylactic cranial irradiation. This is to match recommendation 1.4.55. In addition, the reviewed clinical trials gave
thoracic radiotherapy alongside prophylactic cranial irradiation. The evidence showed that prophylactic cranial

the UK that routine MRI follow-up may be more cost effective. The committee made a recommendation for research on
prophylactic cranial irradiation compared with routine MRI follow-up in extensive-stage SCLC, to provide evidence more
relevant to the UK and to see if MRI could identify people who need whole-brain radiotherapy and so reduce the number of
people having unnecessary treatment. The 2011 recommendation only recommended thoracic radiotherapy for people with a

lifestyle (especially smoking) and occupation. Lung cancer is estimated to cost the UK economy £2.4 billion per year.
Note: all statistics in this section are from Cancer Research UK's Lung Cancer Statistics. Lung cancer is diagnosed and
staged using a variety of tests, including chest X-rays, CT or positron-emission tomography CT (PET-CT). Lung cancer
samples are commonly acquired for diagnosis using bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or a percutaneous
procedure (guided by CT or ultrasound). Lung cancer has 2 main types: • non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is
more common and spreads more slowly • small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is rarer and spreads more quickly. Treatment
depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer, and the person's health. Possible treatments include
radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery, supportive care cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and ablation. ©
NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 46 Since 2011, when the NICE lung cancer guideline was
last updated, there have been changes in the way that lung cancer is diagnosed and treated. The Royal College of
Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that only 72% of people have pathological
confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in the availability of molecular testing in lung cancer
diagnosis. NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as improve access to and uptake of
radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely used for certain subgroups of people with
early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of licensed immunotherapies and biological targeted therapies for treating
advanced NSCLC, and NICE has published technology appraisals covering many of these. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 38 Brain imaging for people having treatment with curative
intent Recommendations 1.3.23 to 1.3.25 Brain imaging is helpful before starting treatment with curative intent, because
if brain metastases are detected then the treatment plan is likely to change. However, routine brain imaging is
expensive, and the evidence showed that it does not always offer a good balance of benefits and costs. In people with
stage II and IIIA disease, the benefits of brain imaging outweigh the costs because: • brain metastases are more common
than in stage I disease • people can start early treatment for metastases if they are identified, which improves
prognosis • some people with brain metastases will not have radical treatment (depending on factors such as the number
of metastases, prognosis and patient preference), and this reduces costs. In people with clinical stage I NSCLC and no
neurological symptoms, the prevalence of detectable brain metastases is fairly low (around 4%) compared with people with
stage II or IIIA disease. People with stage I NSCLC who do have brain metastases often still have radical lung
treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of
metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of people having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging
in this population are too low to justify the costs. The 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness
of imaging after the treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient to conduct
CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committee made a recommendation for research on
routine brain imaging with CT at initial diagnosis and/or staging. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice
of rights  Page 39 Practice in this area is variable. The committee estimated that the recommendations will increase the
number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this should prevent the use of treatment options (such as
lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some patients for whom it is not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may
also lead to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and brain surgery. These treatments would be
expected to improve the person's prognosis, although each treatment would carry its own risks and side effects. Return
to recommendations Surgery and radiotherapy with curative intent for non-small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.6.1
and 1.6.5 to 1.6.12 For people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are well enough and for whom treatment with
curative intent is suitable, the evidence showed that lobectomy provides better survival outcomes than stereotactic
ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Lobectomy is a good compromise between preserving pulmonary function and being more likely
to remove cancerous cells compared with sublobar resection. For people with stage I–IIA (T1a–T2b, N0, M0) NSCLC, t

s. The key benefit associated with chemoradiotherapy and surgery is the longer progression-free survival time. An
analysis of multiple trials showed improved progression- free survival and cost effectiveness for chemoradiotherapy with
surgery, compared with chemoradiotherapy alone. There was an 89% probability that chemoradiotherapy and surgery improved
average overall survival time compared with chemoradiotherapy. However, the evidence in favour of chemoradiotherapy and
surgery involved indirect comparisons, and no head-to-head trials showed meaningful differences in overall survival for
any of the interventions. And as with any major surgery, there is a perioperative mortality risk for people who have
chemoradiotherapy and surgery. The 3 to 5 week wait for surgery is recommended to give people time to recover from the
chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy with surgery is not often offered in current practice. In addition, there are
specific factors to take into account when offering all these treatments together. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams
providing it should have expertise both in the combined therapy, and in all the individual components. Immunotherapy has
been shown to be effective in a variety of NSCLC indications but there is currently no evidence on whether it is
clinically or cost effective for people with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC following surgery. The committee made a recommendation
for research on immunotherapy after multimodality treatment to address this. The committee felt that chemoradiotherapy
and surgery is offered far less often than chemoradiotherapy alone or chemotherapy and surgery for people with NSCLC
stage IIIA- N2. Therefore, these recommendations could lead to a change in current practice. Return to recommendations ©
NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 42 First-line treatment for limited-stage disease
small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5 The evidence showed a survival benefit from twice-daily
radiotherapy compared with once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people with small-cell lung cancer will
not be well enough to tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving people the option of once-daily
radiotherapy. The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1, because this
is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with
concurrent chemotherapy in the section on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer).
However, there was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this is the same as the
original 2011 recommendation. There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because of the limited data, and the
committee's experience that people prefer to complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on
concurrent therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy) is the same as the
2011 recommendation. Return to recommendations Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell

to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and
carers or guardian. All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a
procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when
individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and
national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to
eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this
guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties. Commissioners and
providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and
reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible. © NICE 2024. All rights

emoradiotherapy and surgery involved indirect comparisons, and no head-to-head trials showed meaningful differences in
overall survival for any of the interventions. And as with any major surgery, there is a perioperative mortality risk
for people who have chemoradiotherapy and surgery. The 3 to 5 week wait for surgery is recommended to give people time
to recover from the chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy with surgery is not often offered in current practice. In
addition, there are specific factors to take into account when offering all these treatments together. Therefore,
multidisciplinary teams providing it should have expertise both in the combined therapy, and in all the individual
components. Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a variety of NSCLC indications but there is currently no
evidence on whether it is clinically or cost effective for people with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC following surgery. The
committee made a recommendation for research on immunotherapy after multimodality treatment to address this. The
committee felt that chemoradiotherapy and surgery is offered far less often than chemoradiotherapy alone or chemotherapy
and surgery for people with NSCLC stage IIIA- N2. Therefore, these recommendations could lead to a change in current
practice. Return to recommendations © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 42 First-line
treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5 The evidence showed a
survival benefit from twice-daily radiotherapy compared with once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people
with small-cell lung cancer will not be well enough to tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving
people the option of once-daily radiotherapy. The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in
chemotherapy cycle 1, because this is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the recommendation on
twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in the section on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease
small-cell lung cancer). However, there was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on
this is the same as the original 2011 recommendation. There were limited data available on whether continuous
radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because of
the limited data, and the committee's experience that people prefer to complete treatment as quickly as possible, the
2019 recommendation on concurrent therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011 recommendation. Return to recommendations Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic
cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.12.3 and 1.12.4 © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.
Subject to Notice of rights  Page 43 There was some uncertainty in the evidence. However, the study most relevant to UK
practice showed that thoracic radiotherapy improves long-term survival for people who have had a partial or complete

be fibreoptic, video or hybrid. • Recommendation 1.3.30 has had a reference to the Welsh Government and Department of

e with NSCLC stage IIIA- N2. Therefore, these recommendations could lead to a change in current practice. Return to
recommendations © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 42 First-line treatment for limited-
stage disease small-cell lung cancer Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5 The evidence showed a survival benefit from twice-
daily radiotherapy compared with once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people with small-cell lung cancer
will not be well enough to tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving people the option of once-daily
radiotherapy. The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1, because this
is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with
concurrent chemotherapy in the section on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer).
However, there was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this is the same as the
original 2011 recommendation. There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because of the limited data, and the
committee's experience that people prefer to complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on
concurrent therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy) is the same as the
2011 recommendation. Return to recommendations Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell
lung cancer Recommendations 1.12.3 and 1.12.4 © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 43
There was some uncertainty in the evidence. However, the study most relevant to UK practice showed that thoracic
radiotherapy improves long-term survival for people who have had a partial or complete response to chemotherapy, if they
live longer than 1 year after the radiotherapy. The committee specified that thoracic radiotherapy should be given
alongside prophylactic cranial irradiation. This is to match recommendation 1.4.55. In addition, the reviewed clinical
trials gave thoracic radiotherapy alongside prophylactic cranial irradiation. The evidence showed that prophylactic
cranial irradiation improves survival versus best supportive care. are limited. There is also some evidence from a study
outside the UK that routine MRI follow-up may be more cost effective. The committee made a recommendation for research
on prophylactic cranial irradiation compared with routine MRI follow-up in extensive-stage SCLC, to provide evidence
more relevant to the UK and to see if MRI could identify people who need whole-brain radiotherapy and so reduce the
number of people having unnecessary treatment. The 2011 recommendation only recommended thoracic radiotherapy for people
with a complete response to chemotherapy at distant sites. Therefore, this recommendation could increase the number of
people who are given thoracic radiotherapy. It is likely that the recommendation reflects current clinical practice. ©

main types: • non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is more common and spreads more slowly • small-cell lung cancer
(SCLC), which is rarer and spreads more quickly. Treatment depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer,
and the person's health. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery, supportive
care cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and ablation. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page
46 Since 2011, when the NICE lung cancer guideline was last updated, there have been changes in the way that lung cancer
is diagnosed and treated. The Royal College of Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that
only 72% of people have pathological confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in the availability
of molecular testing in lung cancer diagnosis. NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as
improve access to and uptake of radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely used for
certain subgroups of people with early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of licensed immunotherapies and biological
targeted therapies for treating advanced NSCLC, and NICE has published technology appraisals covering many of these. ©
