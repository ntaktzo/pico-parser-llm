Currently, treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in
the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations. In
practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the effect. Therefore, the analysis of

included clinical trials published in English, about patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with
dysregulation of the MET pathway, with single-agent treatment with a MET inhibitor, reporting on the
objective response rate, disease control rate, and adverse events. In total, 11 studies were included. Of these

CheckMate 816 trial (Forde 2022) included patients with early-stage NSCLC (IB (≥4 cm) to IIIA NSCLC) (7th TNM classification) and no known EGFR/ALK alterations. This trial compared nivolumab (360 mg) plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (three cycles) to chemotherapy alone (Table 4). The neoadjuvant treatment was followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both.

ion TKI versus first generation TKI on QoL. In the Archer 1050 study, transformed Global Health Status(GHS)/QoL scores were calculated on a scale ranging to 100, where 100 represents excellent health. The transformed GHS/QoL scores ranged between 61.5 (cycle 30) and 69.8 (cycle 28) after first line treatment with dacomitinib. Transformed GHS/QoL scores ranged between 68.5 (cycle 17) and 73.1 (cycle 28) in the gefitinib group. This difference was not considered clinically relevant (difference less than 10 points).

Both treatment arms showed improvements from baseline to randomized treatment discontinuation.

Wat is de waarde van screening naar longcarcinoom?
Aanbeveling
Longcarcinoom screening wordt geadviseerd bij hoog-risico groepen, door centra die beschikken over een
low-dose CT en specifieke software. Daarnaast moeten er kennis en competenties voor screening aanwezig
zijn.
Stoppen met roken is een integraal onderdeel van screening.

diagnostiek noodzakelijk is dan in de NLST-trial. Dat wil zeggen dat de kosteneffectiviteit zal verbeteren en

De United States Preventive Services Task Force beveelt jaarlijkse screening aan met een low-dose CT voor
de leeftijdscategorie 55 - 80 jaar met 30 pack years en roker zijn of in de afgelopen 15 jaar zijn gestopt met

Samenvatting literatuur
Hoewel een aantal wetenschappelijke verenigingen longcarcinoom screening bij hoog-risico groepen (met
name rokers en ex-rokers die ≤10 jaar geleden stopten met roken) aanbeveelt, zijn er wel nog onzeker

=== Intervention Extract 674 (Dose) ===
er wel nog onzekerheden
omtrent de waarde van deze aanbevelingen voor de klinische praktijk. De aanbeveling is met name
gebaseerd op de National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) met 53.454 participanten, die een daling van de
longcarcinoom specifieke mortaliteit met 20% liet zien door toepassing van low-dose CT met een goed
getrainde staf [NSLT 2011(3), 2013(4)]. De totale mortaliteit nam met 6,7% af. In deze studie werd een
positieve uitslag gedefinieerd als de aanwezigheid van een nodule van ≥ 4mm. Het aantal fout-positieve scans
was 23,3%, de positief voorspellende waarde van een positieve screen wa

=== Intervention Extract 675 (Dose) ===
Het aantal fout-positieve scans
was 23,3%, de positief voorspellende waarde van een positieve screen was 3,6%. In het kader van een
bevolkingsonderzoek naar longcarcinoom wordt het Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek
(NELSON) verricht. In deze gerandomiseerde studie wordt met een low-dose CT het nodule volume
gemeten; in beide armen wordt het advies gegeven om te stoppen met roken. Participanten zijn positief als
het nodule volume >500mm (diameter ongeveer 9.8mm) is of de volume verdubbelingstijd (VDT) < 400
dagen. Deze strengere eisen leiden tot een positieve screen bij 485 (6%) va

sche CT in een geïntegreerd
nucleair-geneeskundig-radiologisch verslag te resulteren. Omdat beeldvorming voorafgaat aan de invasieve
diagnostiek is een goede organisatie met korte toegangstijden belangrijk. Voor in opzet curatieve chirurgie
dient tenminste ergens in het traject een FDG-PET (met low-dose CT) te worden verricht.
Onderbouwing
Conclusies
FDG-PET is gevoeliger voor het detecteren van mediastinale lymfekliermetastasen dan een CT.
Niveau 1: A1 Gould 2003, (12) Silvestri 2007, (13) Ung 2007, (14) Dwamena 1999; (11) A2 Pieterman 2000. (9)

bedraagt de sensitiviteit 50-75% bij een specificiteit van
FDG-PET-CT voor mediastinale metastasen (15) (16) (17)
Uit studies wordt duidelijk dat de FDG-PET gelijktijdig gecombineerd met een CT van diagnostische kwaliteit
een betere diagnostische accuratesse heeft dan een FDG-PET met enkel een low-dose CT. Veel van de
artikelen waarop de genoemde reviews zich baseren zijn nog verricht met FDG-PET alleen en niet met
gecombineerde FDG-PET-CT. Een kwalitatief goede primaire diagnostische accuratesse studie met FDG-PET-
CT vergeleek de performance van de FDG-PET component van FDG-PET-CT met CT alleen

Bij alle patiënten met aanwijzingen voor longkanker dient een röntgenthoraxfoto te worden gemaakt. Of
deze in de naaste toekomst vervangen gaat worden door een ‘low-dose' CT is nog onduidelijk. In veel
gevallen is deze al gemaakt (deze was de reden voor het vermoeden van longkanker). In principe wordt zowel
een voor-achterwaartse als een laterale opname aanbevolen in de meeste richtlijnen. Aanbevelingen in

er wel nog onzekerheden omtrent de waarde van deze aanbevelingen voor de klinische praktijk. De aanbeveling is met name gebaseerd op de National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) met 53.454 participanten, die een daling van de longcarcinoom specifieke mortaliteit met 20% liet zien door toepassing van low-dose CT met een goed getrainde staf [NSLT 2011(3), 2013(4)]. De totale mortaliteit nam met 6,7% af. In deze studie werd een positieve uitslag gedefinieerd als de aanwezigheid van een nodule van ≥ 4mm. Het aantal fout-positieve scans was 23,3%, de positief voorspellende waarde van een positieve screen wa

Het aantal fout-positieve scans was 23,3%, de positief voorspellende waarde van een positieve screen was 3,6%. In het kader van een bevolkingsonderzoek naar longcarcinoom wordt het Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) verricht. In deze gerandomiseerde studie wordt met een low-dose CT het nodule volume gemeten; in beide armen wordt het advies gegeven om te stoppen met roken. Participanten zijn positief als het nodule volume >500mm (diameter ongeveer 9.8mm) is of de volume verdubbelingstijd (VDT) < 400 dagen. Deze strengere eisen leiden tot een positieve screen bij 485 (6%) va

Omdat beeldvorming voorafgaat aan de invasieve diagnostiek is een goede organisatie met korte toegangstijden belangrijk.

Het is echter pas na het maken van een plannings-CT mogelijk om te bekijken of de normale weefselbelasting (long, oesofagus, ruggenmerg) te hoog is, bijv. aan de hand van een dosis- volume histogram. Voor longweefsel wordt de gemiddelde longdosis (Mean Lung Dose) of het percentage van het longvolume dat >20 Gy krijgt (V20) gebruikt om de kans op een radiatie pneumonitis in te schatten.
