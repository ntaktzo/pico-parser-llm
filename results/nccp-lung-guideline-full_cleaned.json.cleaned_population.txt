Patient demographics and risk-factors for lung cancer contribute to significant co-morbidities in our
surgical candidate population. This has implications for surgical case selection and outcomes.
For patients who had undergone prior coronary bypass surgery, the risk of death and myocardial

In patients unfit for surgery, SBRT/SABR is the treatment of choice for peripherally located stage I NSCLC (if
SBRT/SABR is not available, a hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule with a high biologically equivalent
dose is advised). (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013)
SBRT/SABR has led to improved population-based survival in elderly patients (Haasbeek et al., 2012), and
the convenience of this outpatient therapy over three to eight visits has also led to a reduction in the
proportion of untreated patients. The SBRT/SABR dose should be to a biologically equivalent tumour dose

To formulate the clinical questions they were broken down into their component parts using the PICO(T)

There were three main points considered when appraising all the research evidence:
• Are the results valid? (internal validity)
• What are the results? (statistical and clinical significance)
• Are the results applicable/generalisable to the patient/population of this guideline? (external validity) The evidence which addressed each clinical question, both from international guidelines and primary
literature, was extracted into evidence tables. Recommendations were formulated through a formal

The following items were considered and documented:
• What evidence is available to answer the clinical question?
• What is the quality of the evidence?
» Is the evidence consistent?
» Is the evidence generalisable to the Irish population?
» Is the evidence applicable in the Irish context?
• What is the potential impact on the health system?
• What is the potential benefit versus harm to the patient?
• Are there resource implications?

The National Cancer Strategy (DoHC, 2006) recommended that national site-specific multidisciplinary
groups be convened to develop national evidence-based clinical guidelines for cancer care. The principal
objective of developing these guidelines is to improve the quality of care received by patients.
A Guideline Development Group was established to develop evidence based guidelines for the diagnosis, The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 (DoH, 2017) recommends: The NCCP will develop further
guidelines for cancer care in line with National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) standards.

Yao et al. (2012) performed a systematic review which compared fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) with

No data have been published so far on the combination of RFA with chemotherapy for early stage non-
small cell lung cancer. (Lim et al., 2010)
Lanuti et al. (2012) performed 55 ablations in 45 patients (age, 51 to 89 years) with stage I NSCLC. At a
median follow-up of 32 months, locoregional recurrence (LRR) occurred in 21 (38%) within a mean of
12±10 (range, 1-44) months from RFA. Recurrence was observed locally in the tumour bed in 18 (33%),

Local control was achieved by repeat RFA in 2 of 5 (40%) or by radiotherapy in 8 lesions (100%), with 2
regional nodal failures (median follow-up, 40±13 months). Overall survival among patients who did or
did not experience LRR was similar (32% to 35%). Repeat RFA was not associated with any significant
complications or procedure-related 30-day mortality. The authors concluded lung RFA is associated with

increased rates of local failure in tumours exceeding 3 cm and in contact with larger segmental vessels.
However, patients with local failure can be promptly salvaged with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy
(SBRT/SABR) or repeat RFA, without detriment to overall survival.

In cases where a specimen shows NSCLC lacking either definite squamous or adenocarcinoma
morphology, immunohistochemistry may refine diagnosis (Travis et al., 2011).
Immunohistochemistry has been routinely used for separating metastatic tumours from primary lung
cancers especially in patients with no known primary tumours, it is also becoming more important in
the classification of primary lung tumours. Indeed, recent advances in targeted therapies (e.g. tyrosine
kinase inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors) have made the distinction between adenocarcinomas
and squamous cell carcinomas

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in 2013 (Oki et al., 2013) to evaluate the efficacy of
rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) during endobronchial ultrasound guided-transbronchial needle aspiration
(EBUS-TBNA) in the diagnosis of lung cancer. One hundred and twenty patients suspected of having
lung cancer with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy were randomised to undergo EBUS-TBNA with or
without ROSE. The sensitivity and accuracy for diagnosing lung cancer were 88% and 89% in the ROSE
group, and 86% and 89% in the non-ROSE group, respectively. No complications were as

the procedures. Additional procedures including EBUS-TBNA for lesions other than the main target lesion
and/or transbronchial biopsy in the same setting were performed in 11% of patients in the ROSE group
and 57% in the non-ROSE group (p<0.001). Mean puncture number was significantly lower in the ROSE
group (2.2 vs. 3.1 punctures, p<0.001), and mean bronchoscopy time was similar between both groups

significantly lower need for additional bronchoscopic procedures and puncture number.
In addition an RCT of 168 patients with enlarged lymph nodes were randomised to undergo TBNA with
or without ROSE (Trisolini et al., 2011). There was no significant difference between the TBNA group

The distinction from metastatic disease may be clear when there are two separate histological subtypes.
Where the same subtype is in both lesions, the criteria proposed by Martini and Melamed (1975) can be
useful (Kozower et al., 2013).
The survival of patients with synchronous primary lung cancer is fairly variable, suggesting that a
thoughtful approach is necessary in classifying two synchronous foci of cancer as two separate primary
lung cancers. (Kozower et al., 2013)

The Cancer Care Ontario Guideline Development Group (Kulkarni et al., 2015) conducted a meta-analysis
of three RCTs (Ciuleanu et al., 2009, Paz-Ares et al., 2012, Rittmeyer et al., 2013). They found that patients
randomised to pemetrexed as maintenance therapy had longer overall survival compared with those who
did not receive maintenance pemetrexed therapy (HR 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.89;

0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.96; p=.014) and progression-free survival (HR 0.74; 95% confidence

(≤2%). Oesophageal toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was 6.6% in the TRT arm and 0% in the non-TRT arm
(p<.001). The study concluded that TRT improves overall survival and progression-free survival in patients

groups be convened to develop national evidence-based clinical guidelines for cancer care. The principal
objective of developing these guidelines is to improve the quality of care received by patients. Other
objectives include:
• Improvement in patient outcomes,
• Potential for reduction in morbidity and mortality,
• Improvement in quality of life,
• Promotion of interventions of proven benefit and discouragement of ineffective ones,

described in detail in the NCCP Methodology Manual for guideline development. The first step in guideline development was to identify areas of new and emerging evidence, areas with
identifiable variation in practice, or areas with potential to impact on patients care. These questions then
formed the basis for the types of evidence being gathered, the search strategy, and the inclusion and
exclusion criteria.
To formulate the clinical questions they were broken down into their component parts using the PICO(T)

al diagnostic strategy for pulmonary nodules presenting to thoracic surgeons
Deppen et al. (2014) present a cost-effectiveness model to examine the cost-effectiveness of computer
assisted navigational bronchoscopy (NB) as an alternative to positron emission tomography (PET) as a
diagnostic tool for patients with lung nodules. Their results suggest that NB is a cost-effective alternative
to PET, although the differences in costs and effects appear relatively small.
The analysis uses a model to compare four diagnostic strategies: the current strategy of PET imaging; NB;

US-TBNA (endosonography) to have lower expected costs and higher expected effectiveness than
mediastinoscopy, but do not find either of these results to be significantly different from zero.
The analysis is based on a randomised control trial (RCT) of the two approaches at four sites which
followed patients for six months. The results of the RCT are combined with quality of life data gathered
within the study in a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis of the data that permits an examination of
uncertainty in the findings.
The analysis notes that the principal differences in costs arise due to both diff

uggests that PET imaging is either cost-saving or cost-effective relative
to other interventional strategies. However, the same study notes that PET is not always found to be cost-
effective.
This is indirectly relevant to recommendation 2.2.1.3 which supports the use of PET-CT for nodal staging in
patients with potentially resectable NSCLC prior to more invasive staging.
The evidence also suggests navigational bronchoscopy, CT-FNA and VATS are all more cost-effective than PET,
although there are several methodological issues highlighted with the internal validity of this analysis and

thoracoscopy (TL). Their principal finding is that TL results in no less QALYs than PLT, but has statistically
significantly reduced costs. Accordingly, the authors conclude that TL is a cost-saving procedure relative
to standard PLT.
The analysis is primarily an observational analysis of 113 patients treated with either TL or PLT at a US
medical centre between 2002 and 2004. The authors record the costs of surgery, including pre- and
post-operative care for up to 30 days following the operation. The costs recorded are those incurred

This is relevant to surgery questions 2.5.2 where the guideline development group recommend that
in patients with clinical stage I (N0) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), video-assisted thoracic surgery

notes that 3D-CRT may be the preferred strategies for tumours in the centre of the chest, where
SBRT is less well tolerated. The above article discusses the cost-effectiveness of techniques relevant to clinical question 2.7.1.
The evidence suggests that SBRT is less costly than surgery in high-risk patients with early stage NSCLC.
However, surgery met the standard for cost-effectiveness due to a longer expected overall survival. This
is supported by recommendation 2.7.1.1.
The evidence also suggests that SBRT compared to 3D-CRT and RFA, was the most cost-effective treatment
