One study compared ABCP with BCP in a total of 800 nonsquamous NSCLC patients with an ECOG
performance-status score of 0 to 1 (Socinski, 2018). After a protocol amendment the primary endpoint overall
survival was reported in the 692 patients who had a wild-type genotype (WT population; patients with EGFR
or ALK genetic alterations were excluded). The percentage of patients alive at 1 year was 67.3% of the 356
patients in the ABCP group versus 60.6% of the 336 patients in the BCP group. The median survival was 19.2
months and 14.7 months, respectively. The HR for death was 0.78 (

Ipilimumab. Socinski (2018) randomised patients into 3 groups, but only reported results of 2 groups. See
