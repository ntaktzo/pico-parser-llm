Results
A total of ten studies were included in the analysis of the literature for EGFR+ NSCLC in adjuvant setting. The
study by Goss (2013) was not included in our summary since only 4% of the study population had an EGFR
mutation-positive tumor and did not meet our criteria. Furthermore, not all described treatments were
available in the Netherlands at the moment of developing this guideline module. The assessment of the risk

y analysis of the use of tecemotide in non-small-cell
lung cancer, and introduction of safety measures by protocol amendment led to the clinical hold being lifted

modified intention-to-treat population was designed for the primary analysis by prospectively excluding
patients randomly assigned within the 6 months preceding the clinical hold. This approach was based on the

survival was reported in the 692 patients who had a wild-type genotype (WT population; patients with EGFR
or ALK genetic alterations were excluded). The percentage of patients alive at 1 year was 67.3% of the 356

patients in the WT population. The median progression free survival was 8.3 months om the ABCP group
versus 6.8 months om the BCP group. The progression free survival rate at 1 year was 36.5% in the ABCP

t with chemo-immunotherapy seems more effective in patients with a PD-L1 expression of 1-50% than in patients with a PD-L1 expression of <1%. Dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy regimens might be an alternative treatment for these patients, but no randomized research has yet been conducted in this population. In this module, the available evidence for dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy for PD-L1 subgroups is described. In line with international guidelines, the focus is on PD-L1 expression of <1%.|

Results
Osimertinib for EGFR+ NSCLC
Currently, osimertinib is the only available treatment in the Netherlands within the adjuvant setting for
patients with a completely resected, early-stage (I to III) pathological confirmed NSCLC harbouring a common
EGFR-mutation. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is restricted to osimertinib.

Overall survival
Results from the ADAURA trial were immature at the time of the analysis of Wu 2022 and could therefore not
be assessed in their systematic review. In June 2023, Tsuboi 2023 published the final analysis of OS data. The
median duration of follow-up for OS in patients with stage II to IIIA disease was 59.9 months (range: 0 to 82) in
the osimertinib group and 56.2 months (range 1 to 86) in the placebo group. The 5-year overall survival was
85% (95% CI: 79% to 89%) in the osimertinib group and 73% (95% CI: 66 to 78) in the placebo group (HR 0.49;

find any differences in OS.
It should be noted that only 79 of 205 patients who had disease recurrence in the placebo group received
osimertinib at relapse in the ADAURA trial.

Subsequent investigations of this patient, an overall safety analysis of the use of tecemotide in non-small-cell

Reck (2016) reported progression free survival in a total of 305 patients. The median progression free survival
was 10.3 months in the pembrolizumab versus 6.0 months in the chemotherapy group in patients with a PD-L1
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater.
The pooled HR for progression or death was 0.50 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.68), meaning that patients in the
pembrolizumab group had a higher chance of progression free survival compared to patients in the

kMate 227 (part 1) described a randomized, open-label,
international, multi-center phase III trial, with a minimum follow-up length of 61.3 months. They evaluated the
efficacy and safety of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab (plus chemotherapy if PD-L1 <1%)
versus chemotherapy in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated with
chemotherapy. A total of 1739 patients was randomized to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus
ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) (n=583), nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks or 360 mg every 3 weeks if

Results
Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy
Currently, treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in
the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations. In
practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the effect. Therefore, the analysis of
outcomes below is restricted to the CheckMate 9LA results in which the intervention consists of nivolumab,
