ntie, omdat deze behandeling al onderdeel is van de standaard zorg. Onderbouwing Achtergrond A combination of platinum
doublet chemotherapy (ChT) with immunotherapy (ICI) is the most common first treatment approach in patients with an
incurable NSCLC without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations (with PS 0-1 and with no contraindications for ICI). It is
recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD- L1≥50% with a smoking history with single-agent ICI in the first-
line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. For patients with disease progression after combination ChT and
ICI, the recommendations for subsequent treatment are not clear and there is uncertainty about level of evidence for
these recommendations. Before the introduction of ICI treatments, docetaxel has shown improved OS compared with best
supportive care (BSC) in second line treatment. Conclusies Overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate,
adverse events, quality of life No evidence was found regarding the effects of docetaxel compared with best supportive
care or other chemotherapy (with or without other treatment) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without
sensitizing oncogene driver mutations after treatment with platinum doublet and (concurrently or consecutive)
immunotherapy. - GRADE Source: - Samenvatting literatuur Description of studies Not applicable. Results Overall

received tecemotide and in 35 patients (7%) who received placebo (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.40, 0.94)). Level of evidence
comparison tecemotide versus placebo There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at
a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcomes overall survival and adverse events was
downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of violation of the intent to treat analysis, 274 patients were
excluded from the primary analysis population as a result of a clinical hold (risk of bias) and 2 levels for imprecision

d at ‘high’, as the included studies were RCTs. The level of evidence regarding the outcome overall survival was
downgraded by three levels because of immature data, wide confidence intervals that include both a clinically relevant
difference and no clinically relevant difference (very serious imprecision, two levels) and potential publication bias
as in both trials the funders were involved in designing the study, data analysis and data interpretation (one level).
Therefore, the level of evidence was graded as very low. The level of evidence regarding the outcome disease-free
survival was downgraded by two levels because of wide confidence intervals that include both a clinically relevant
difference and no clinically relevant difference (serious imprecision, one level) and potential publication bias (one
level). Therefore, the level of evidence was graded as low. The level of evidence regarding the outcome adverse events
was downgraded by two levels because of the absence of blinding in one trial and immature data for long-term adverse
events (risk of bias, one level), and potential publication bias (one level). Therefore, the level of evidence was
graded as low. The level of evidence could not be graded for the outcome quality of life, as it was not reported in the
included studies. Zoeken en selecteren A systematic review of the literature was performed to answer the following
question: What are the effects of neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with early-stage (I to IIIA)

outcome measures for decision making. A priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above but
used the definitions used in the studies. The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important
differences. For these definitions, the PASKWIL criteria for adjuvant treatment  were used where possible, since there
are no specific criteria for neoadjuvant therapy): Overall survival: >5% difference between the groups or >3% difference

literatuur A systematic review that reviewed clinical outcomes after targeted therapy or chemotherapy in NSCLC patients
with an ALK fusion was included in this literature analysis. Description of studies Peng (2023) performed a systematic
review and network meta-analysis of studies to investigate the relative safety and efficacy of all first‐line treatments
for patients with ALK‐positive NSCLC. The literature search covered the period 2013–2021. The review included
published/unpublished phase 2/3 randomized clinical trials in patients with histopathologically confirmed advanced
(III/IV/recurrent) NSCLC with ALK gene fusions. Articles were included if there was a comparison of any two or more arms
of first‐line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK gene fusions, and reported on at least one of the
following clinical outcome measures: progression‐free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS), objective response rate
(ORR), grade ≥3 treatment‐related adverse events. The following studies were excluded: Trials in which patients with
ALK‐positive NSCLC were analyzed as a subgroup, trials of ALK‐ TKIs not as first‐line therapy, but as maintenance or
neoadjuvant therapy or sequential therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy; and trials comparing treatments that have
not been approved by any Food and Drug Administration. In total, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
All trials were industry sponsored or designed in cooperation with the industry. Important study characteristics of the

were used. Fifteen studies with 19,882 patients were included in the primary meta-analysis for overall survival.
Toxicity was not reported as an outcome in the systematic review by Chen (2018). After reading the original reports, we
found that only four of the included studies reported toxicity in both treatment arms (Ezer, 2015; Verstegen, 2013;
Crabtree, 2010; Robinson, 2013). Data on the number of patients with toxicity in each group were substracted from the
original reports.|| Row 7: || Row 8: Furthermore, two recent observational studies were included. Stokes (2018) reported
the results of surgery or SBRT using data from the American National Cancer Database, a hospital-based registry that
captures approximately 70% of incident cancer cases in the United States. 84.839 patients with cT1-T2a, N0, M0 NSCLC
diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 undergoing either surgery or SBRT. For this analysis, data from 27,200 propensity
score–matched patients were used. 6,800 patients underwent SBRT. SBRT fractionation schedules were 50 Gy in five
fractions (19.3%), 60 Gy in three fractions (17.7%), 48 Gy in four fractions (17.0%), and 54 Gy in three fractions
(14.0%). 20,400 patients underwent surgery (lobectomy (77.7%), sublobar resection (20.3%), or pneumonectomy (2.0%)).
Outcome measures were the 30- and 90-day post- treatment mortality rates.|| Row 9: || Row 10: Wolff (2018) described the
results in patients’ quality of life in two prospective cohorts of patients with stage I NSCLC who were treated either
with SBRT or surgery. Data were from two hospitals in the Netherlands. 261 patients were treated by stereotactic
radiotherapy, of whom 41 patients were included in the propensity score matched cohort (N=18 were treated with 5x12 Gy;
N=15: 3x20 Gy; N=4: 3x18 Gy; N=4: 8x7.5 Gy). 41 patients underwent lobectomy (n=32 thoracotomy – lobectomy, n=5 VATS
lobectomy, N=2 Bilobectomy, N=1 Wedge, N=1 Pneumonectomy). Health utility was measured with European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30). The average health utility for the
first year was calculated as the weighted average of baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.|| Row 11: || Row 12: Study results||

of sotorasib versus docetaxel on AEs. Treatment related adverse events grade ≥3 occurred in 56 (33%) patients in the
sotorasib arm and in 61 (40%) patients in the docetaxel arm. This difference was not considered clinically relevant. The
authors stated that, all treatment-related adverse events grade ≥3 of diarrhoea and increased ALT or AST in the
sotorasib group resolved after dose interruption, reduction, or both. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-
tivantinib versus chemotherapy on AEs. Grade ≥3 events occurred more frequently in the control arm. Treatment-related
serious AEs were 10% in erlotinib-tivantinib arm and 22% in chemotherapy arm. This difference was not considered
clinically relevant. Quality of Life - Important outcome One of the two included studies reported on Quality of Life
(QoL). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on QoL. QoL measures were improved for
sotorasib versus docetaxel for the following outcomes: Time to deterioration in global health status (HR 0.69; 95% CI:
0.53–0.91), physical functioning (0.69; 0.52–0.92), and the cancer-related symptoms dyspnoea (0.63; 95% CI: 0.48–0.83)
and cough (0.55 (0.38–0.80). The authors state that this difference was considered clinically meaningful. A greater
improvement from baseline in global health status was observed in the sotorasib arm for physical functioning (8.8), and
dyspnoea (–10.1) until week 12 compared to docetaxel. Level of evidence There are four levels of evidence: high,
moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. Sotorasib versus docetaxel The level of evidence
for OS, PFS, ORR, and AEs and QoL were downgraded with two levels because of risk of bias (no blinding, missing outcome
data) and imprecision (OIS not reached). Erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy The level of evidence for OS, PFS,
ORR, and AEs and QoL were downgraded with two levels because of risk of bias (no blinding, unclear randomization
process) and imprecision (OIS not reached). Zoeken en selecteren The search and selection methods can be found in the

objective response rate, adverse events, and quality of Life in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV
and an ALK-fusion. VERY LOW GRADE The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of targeted therapy (crizotinib or
ceritinib) versus chemotherapy on overall survival, objective response rate, adverse events, and quality of life in
patients with non–small-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK-fusion. Objective response rate The evidence is very

after targeted therapy or chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with an ALK fusion was included in this literature analysis.
Description of studies Peng (2023) performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies to investigate the
relative safety and efficacy of all first‐line treatments for patients with ALK‐positive NSCLC. The literature search
covered the period 2013–2021. The review included published/unpublished phase 2/3 randomized clinical trials in patients
with histopathologically confirmed advanced (III/IV/recurrent) NSCLC with ALK gene fusions. Articles were included if
there was a comparison of any two or more arms of first‐line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK gene
fusions, and reported on at least one of the following clinical outcome measures: progression‐free survival (PFS),

rted in the alectinib group and 13 deaths (21%) reported in the crizotinib group. In the J-ALEX study, OS data remain
immature, with only nine events reported (2% in the crizotinib group and 7% in the alectinib group). Two studies
(PROFILE1029 and PROFILE1014) reported the effect of crizotinib versus chemotherapy on overall survival. In the
PROFILE1029 study, 72 patients died 35 (33.7%) in the crizotinib arm and 37 (35.9%) in the chemotherapy arm). Median OS
was 28.5 months (95% CI: 26.4–not reached) with crizotinib and 27.7 months (95% CI: 23.9–not reached) with chemotherapy.
In the PROFILE1014 study, median OS was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) for the crizotinib group and was
47.5 months (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR) for the chemotherapy group. In the ASCEND-4 study, data about the effect of
ceritinib versus chemotherapy on overall survival remained immature at data cutoff. At data cutoff, 48 events occurred
in the ceritinib group and 59 events in the chemotherapy group, representing 42% of the required events for final OS
analysis. The median overall survival was not reached in the ceritinib group (95% CI 29∙3 to not estimable) and was 26∙2
months (22∙8 to not estimable) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0∙73 [95% CI 0∙50–1∙08]; p=0∙056). This difference was not
considered clinically relevant. The 2-year estimated OS rates were 70∙6% (95% CI 62.2–77.5) in the ceritinib group and
58.2% (47.6–67.5) in the chemotherapy group. Figure 1. Forest plot Overall survival newer generation targeted therapy
versus chemotherapy or crizotinib (when compared with next generation TKI) Progression free survival (PFS) - Important
outcome Nine of the nine studies included in the systematic review by Peng (2023) reported on progression free survival
(Figure 2). In the eXalt3 study, 119 PFS events occurred in the mITT population (62.6% of the 190 expected PFS events).
The median PFS was not reached in the ensartinib group (95% CI, 20.2 months to not reached) and 12.7 months in the
crizotinib group (95 CI%: 8.9-16.6; HR: 0.45 95%CI: 0.30-0.66; log-rank P < .001). This difference was considered
clinically relevant. In the ALTA-1L study, 166 PFS events occurred, of which 73 in the brigatinib arm (53%) and 93 in
the crizotinib arm (67%). The estimated 3-year PFS was 43% (95% CI: 34%–51%) in the brigatinib arm and 19% (95% CI:
12%–27%) in the crizotinib arm (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.35–0.66). This difference was considered clinically relevant.
Blinded independent review showed a 4-year PFS 36% (26%–46%) in the brigatinib arm and 18% (11%–26%) in the crizotinib
arm. However, this result was limited by a high rate of censoring and few patients at risk in each group. In the CROWN
study, 127 PFS events occurred at data cutoff, of which 41 in the lorlatinib group (28%) and 86 in the crizotinib group
(59%). The 12-month PFS was 78% (95% CI: 70–84) in the lorlatinib group and 39% (95% CI: 30–48) in the crizotinib group.
HR for disease progression or death= 0.28 (95% CI, 0.19–0.41). This difference was considered clinically relevant Three
studies (ALEX, ALESIA, J-ALEX) reported the effect of alectinib versus crizotinib on PFS. In the ALEX study, 203
patients experienced a PFS event, of which 81 (53.3%) in the alectinib group and 122 (80.8%) in the crizotinib group.

In the intervention arm patients received erlotinib (150 mg orally daily at least 1 hour prior to and at least 2 hours
after ingestion of food) in combination with tivantinib (360 mg orally twice daily with meals). In the control arm
patients received investigator’s choice chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1250mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days, docetaxel 75
mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days, or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days). The study reported the following outcomes:
overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). The
median duration of follow-up was 3.4 months. Study results Overall survival - Critical outcome Two of the two included
studies reported on overall survival (OS). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on OS as
secondary endpoint. The study was not powered for OS. Treatment with sotorasib resulted in similar OS compared to
treatment with docetaxel (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.77–1.33). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Median OS
was 10·6 months (95% CI 8·9–14·0) for patients in the sotorasib arm and 11·3 months (95% CI 9·0–14·9) for patients in
the docetaxel arm. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on OS. Median OS was
6.8 months for patients in the erlotinib-tivantinib arm and 8.5 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.20;
95% CI: 0.76–1.88; P=0.44). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Progression free survival -
Important outcome Two of the two included studies reported on progression free survival (PFS). De Langen (2023) reported
the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on PFS. Treatment with sotorasib resulted in a statistically significant
improvement in PFS compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 0·66; 95% CI: 0·51–0·86). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI:
4·3–7·8) in the sotorasib arm and 4·5 months (3·0–5·7) in the docetaxel arm. The 12-month PFS was 24·8% for sotorasib
versus 10·1% for docetaxel. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on PFS.
Treatment with erlotinib-tivantinib resulted in a similar PFS compared to treatment with chemotherapy. Median PFS was
1.7 months (95% CI: 1.6–5.6) for patients treated with erlotinib-tivantinib and 4.3 months (95% CI: 1.6–5.8 months) for
those treated with chemotherapy (HR 1.19; 95% CI: 0.71–1.97). Objective response rate - Important outcome Two of the two
included studies reported on Objective response rate (ORR). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus
docetaxel on ORR. In patients treated with sotorasib 28.1% (95% CI 21·5–35·4) responded versus 13.2% (95% CI: 8·6–19·2)
in patients treated with docetaxel (p<0·001; difference of proportions of objective response 14·8 (6·4–23·1), NNT=7).
This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus
chemotherapy on ORR. There was no radiographic response in the erlotinib-tivantinib group and ORR was 4.4% in the
chemotherapy arm. This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Adverse events - Important outcome Two of the

Gerber (2018) Samenvatting literatuur Two trials that examined clinical outcomes after targeted therapy in NSCLC
patients with a KRAS G12C mutation were included in this literature analysis. Description of studies Codebreak-200;
NCT04303780 – De Langen (2023) studied patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, who had disease progression after
previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor in a randomized, open-label, phase III study. The
study enrolled patients at 148 academic and community centres in 22 countries. In the intervention arm 171 patients
received treatment with Sotorasib 960 mg orally once daily. In the control arm 174 patients received Docetaxel 75 mg/m²
intravenously every 3 weeks. The study reported the following outcomes: progression free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), overall response rate, safety, and patient reported outcomes (PROs). The median duration of follow-up was
17.7 months (IQR 16.4–20.1). NCT01395758 – Gerber (2018) studied patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic

are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of
quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of
inconsistency (variance of point estimates across studies) and imprecision (overlap with the border of clinical
relevance). The level of quality of evidence for the outcomes progression free survival and response rate was downgraded
with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision (total number of patients <2000 per group). The level of
quality of evidence for the outcome adverse events was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of
inconsistency of results (variance of point estimates across studies) and imprecision (overlap with the border of
clinical relevance). As none of the included studies reported data on the quality of life, it was not possible to assess
the level of evidence. Ipilimumab with chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) versus chemotherapy
(carboplatin/paclitaxel) 1. Overall survival (critical outcome) Two studies comparing ipilimumab with chemotherapy with
chemotherapy alone reported overall survival (Govindan, 2017; Lynch, 2012) in a total of 953 patients with NSCLC and an
ECOG performance-status score of 0 to 1. Lynch 2012) assessed the effect of a concurrent ipilimumab regimen with
carboplatin/paclitaxel a phased ipilimumab regimen with carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel alone and
included both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC patients. Govindan (2017) only included squamous NSCLC patients who were
randomly assigned 1:1 to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel plus blinded ipilimumab 10mg/kg or placebo every three weeks
on a phased induction schedule. The patients with stable disease or better after induction treatment were treated with
maintenance ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks. Govindan (2017) reported the percentage alive at 1 year, which was 54%
in the ipilimumab group versus 53% in the chemotherapy group and respectively 24% and 18% after 2 years. In the study of
Lynch (2012), the median survival was 9.7 months in the concurrent ipilimumab group, 12.2 months in the phased
ipilimumab group and 8.3 months in the chemotherapy group. The pooled HR for death was 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.06),
favouring ipilimumab (figure 5) but the difference was not statistically significant. Figure 5 Overall survival

metastases, bone metastases, CNS metastases and PD-L1 status. Rizvi (2020) – MYSTIC described a randomized, open-label,
international, multi-center phase III trial, with a median follow-up of 30.2 months. They evaluated the efficacy and
safety of first-line durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus durvalumab alone versus chemotherapy in patients with
treatment-naive, metastatic (stage IV) non–small cell lung cancer who had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK genetic
alterations. A total of 1118 patients was randomized to receive durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks) plus tremelimumab (1
mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses), or durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks), or chemotherapy (4 to 6 cycles of the
investigato’rs choice). The median age (range) was 65 (34-87), 64 (32-84), and 65 (35-85) for the three groups,
respectively. The percentage of males in the three groups was 72, 69 and 65%, respectively. The following relevant
outcomes were reported: OS, PFS, ORR, AEs, QoL. Subgroup analyses were done according to PD- L1 expression level (<1%,
≥1%, 25-49%, ≥50%). Results Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy Currently, treatment with nivolumab plus
ipilimumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV
without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations. In practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate
the effect. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is restricted to the CheckMate 9LA results in which the
intervention consists of nivolumab, ipilimumab and chemotherapy and the control of chemotherapy alone. Overall survival
(critical) PD-L1 <1%* In patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1%, the median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months
(95% CI: 13.7 to not reached) in the dual immunotherapy plus chemotherapy (CT) group (69 events/135 patients) and 9.8
months (95% CI: 7.7-13.7) in the CT group (89 events/129 patients) in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of
8.1 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.85) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group.
This difference was considered clinically relevant. In the 2-year update, the median OS in patients with a PD-L1
expression level of <1% was 17.7 months (95% CI: 13.7-20.3) in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 9.8 months (95%
CI: 7.7-13.5) in the CT group with a minimum follow-up of 24.4 months (Reck, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% CI:
0.51 to 0.88) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group. This difference was considered clinically relevant. The 2023
ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an OS rate of 23% for the dual immunotherapy plus CT group versus
13% in the CT group for the PD-L1 <1% cohort (Carbone, 2023). Further peer-reviewed results are awaited. Progression-
free survival PD-L1 <1% In patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1%, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was
5.8 months (95% CI: 4.4 to 7.6) in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group (44 events/135 patients) and 4.6 months (95% CI:
4.2 to 5.6) in the CT group (28 events/129 patients) in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 6.5 months

nieuwere generatie ALK-TKI in de eerste lijn. Na progressie op een tweede of derde generatie ALK-TKI kan er, afhankelijk
van het resistentiepatroon en de eerder gegeven ALK-TKI, geswitcht worden naar een andere ALK-TKI (te selecteren op

studies Peng (2023) performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies to investigate the relative
safety and efficacy of all first‐line treatments for patients with ALK‐positive NSCLC. The literature search covered the
period 2013–2021. The review included published/unpublished phase 2/3 randomized clinical trials in patients with
histopathologically confirmed advanced (III/IV/recurrent) NSCLC with ALK gene fusions. Articles were included if there
was a comparison of any two or more arms of first‐line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK gene
fusions, and reported on at least one of the following clinical outcome measures: progression‐free survival (PFS),
Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), grade ≥3 treatment‐related adverse events. The following studies
were excluded: Trials in which patients with ALK‐positive NSCLC were analyzed as a subgroup, trials of ALK‐ TKIs not as
first‐line therapy, but as maintenance or neoadjuvant therapy or sequential therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy;
and trials comparing treatments that have not been approved by any Food and Drug Administration. In total, nine
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. All trials were industry sponsored or designed in cooperation with

CI 0.41 to 0.63) favouring durvalumab. PD-L1 subgroups The progression-free survival benefit with durvalumab was
observed irrespective of PD-L1 expression before chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.82) for a PD-L1 expression
level of < 25% and 0.41 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.65) for a PD-L1 expression level of ≥ 25%) at the time of the first data cut-
off point with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. 3. Response rate Patients receiving durvalumab had a higher clinical
response compared to patients receiving placebo in the PACIFIC-study. The objective response was 30.0% (95% CI 25.8 to
34.5) in the durvalumab group versus 17.8% (95% CI 13.0 to 34.5) in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.76 (95% CI 1.25
to 2.49). The median duration of response was not reached in the durvalumab group at a median follow-up time of 25.2
months and 18.4 months (95% CI 6.7 to 24.5) in the placebo group. 4. Quality of life The PACIFIC-study did not publish
data on the quality of life yet. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Adverse events of any cause and grade occurred
in 460 (96.8%) patients in the durvalumab group versus 222 (94.9%) in the placebo group (RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.06)).
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any cause occurred in 145 (30.5%) patients in the durvalumab group versus 61 (26.1%) in
the placebo group (RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.51)). Grade 5 adverse events of any cause occurred in 21 patients (4.4%)
who received durvalumab and in 14 patients (6.0%) who received placebo (RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.43)). Treatment
related adverse events were only reported at the first data cut-off point with a median follow-up of 14.5 months.
Treatment related adverse events of any grade occurred in 322 (67.8%) patients in the durvalumab group versus 125
(53.4%) in the placebo group (RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.45)). Treatment related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in
56 (11.8%) patients in the durvalumab group versus 10 (4.4%) in the placebo group (RR 2.76 (95% CI 1.43 to 5.31)). Level
of evidence comparison durvalumab versus placebo There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low.
RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcomes overall survival and toxicity
was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision of results (total number of patients < 2000 per
group). The level of quality of evidence for the outcomes progression free survival and response rate was downgraded
with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision of results (total number of patients < 2000 per group). As the
included study did not report data on the quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of evidence.

torasib versus docetaxel on PFS. Treatment with sotorasib resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS
compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 0·66; 95% CI: 0·51–0·86). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4·3–7·8) in the
sotorasib arm and 4·5 months (3·0–5·7) in the docetaxel arm. The 12-month PFS was 24·8% for sotorasib versus 10·1% for
docetaxel. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on PFS. Treatment with
erlotinib-tivantinib resulted in a similar PFS compared to treatment with chemotherapy. Median PFS was 1.7 months (95%
CI: 1.6–5.6) for patients treated with erlotinib-tivantinib and 4.3 months (95% CI: 1.6–5.8 months) for those treated
with chemotherapy (HR 1.19; 95% CI: 0.71–1.97). Objective response rate - Important outcome Two of the two included
studies reported on Objective response rate (ORR). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on
ORR. In patients treated with sotorasib 28.1% (95% CI 21·5–35·4) responded versus 13.2% (95% CI: 8·6–19·2) in patients
treated with docetaxel (p<0·001; difference of proportions of objective response 14·8 (6·4–23·1), NNT=7). This
difference was not considered clinically relevant. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus
chemotherapy on ORR. There was no radiographic response in the erlotinib-tivantinib group and ORR was 4.4% in the
chemotherapy arm. This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Adverse events - Important outcome Two of the
two included studies reported on Adverse Events (AEs). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus
docetaxel on AEs. Treatment related adverse events grade ≥3 occurred in 56 (33%) patients in the sotorasib arm and in 61
(40%) patients in the docetaxel arm. This difference was not considered clinically relevant. The authors stated that,
all treatment-related adverse events grade ≥3 of diarrhoea and increased ALT or AST in the sotorasib group resolved
after dose interruption, reduction, or both. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus
chemotherapy on AEs. Grade ≥3 events occurred more frequently in the control arm. Treatment-related serious AEs were 10%
in erlotinib-tivantinib arm and 22% in chemotherapy arm. This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Quality
of Life - Important outcome One of the two included studies reported on Quality of Life (QoL). De Langen (2023) reported
the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on QoL. QoL measures were improved for sotorasib versus docetaxel for the
following outcomes: Time to deterioration in global health status (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53–0.91), physical functioning
(0.69; 0.52–0.92), and the cancer-related symptoms dyspnoea (0.63; 95% CI: 0.48–0.83) and cough (0.55 (0.38–0.80). The
authors state that this difference was considered clinically meaningful. A greater improvement from baseline in global
health status was observed in the sotorasib arm for physical functioning (8.8), and dyspnoea (–10.1) until week 12
compared to docetaxel. Level of evidence There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs

chemotherapy Description of studies The IMpower010 trial (Felip, 2021; Felip, 2023) was an open-label, global trial
conducted in Australia, Europe, Canada, Asia, Russian Federation, and the United States. A total of 1005 patients with
resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (7th TNM classification) was randomized to receive adjuvant atezolizumab (16 cycles or 1
year) (n=507) or best supportive care (n=498). Both groups received up to four 21-day cycles of cisplatin-based adjuvant
chemotherapy in the enrollment phase. The mean follow-up of the DFS interim analysis (Felip, 2021) was 32.2 (27.5-38.4)
months. The mean follow-up of the OS interim analysis (Felip, 2023) was 45.3 months (IQR F Hoffmann-La Roche and
Genentech were involved in designing the trial and analyzing and interpreting the data. It was noticed that three
secondary outcome measures in the trial registry were not reported (details in RoB table). The primary endpoint was
disease-free survival. The IMpower010 results presented at the ASCO 2023 were not systematically worked out, as the
peer- reviewed article was not published yet at the moment of writing this module (October 2023). The PEARLS /
KEYNOTE-091 trial (O’Brien 2022) was a triple-blinded (patients, healthcare professionals, outcome assessors) RCT and
conducted among centers in Australia, Europe, Canada, Asia, Russian Federation, and the United States. A total of 1177
patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (7th TNM classification) was randomized to receive adjuvant
pembrolizumab (up to 18 cycles) (n=590) or placebo (n=587). Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended but not mandatory. The
median follow-up was 35.6 months (IQR 27.1-45.5). Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) participated in study design, data analysis,

gezondheidszorgsysteem. De hoge kosten van de behandeling zouden moeten worden gewogen tegen de verwachte kwaliteit van
de overlevingswinst. Het Zorginstituut (ZIN) heeft het Pakketadvies voor ADAURA gepubliceerd. In het Pakketadvies van
Zorginstituut Nederland (link naar advies) is de kosteneffectiviteit van adjuvante behandeling met osimertinib na
volledige tumorresectie bij volwassenen met stadium IB-IIIA niet-kleincellige longkanker met tumoren met EGFR-mutaties
in Nederland onderzocht. Zorginstituut Nederland heeft geconcludeerd dat adjuvante behandeling met osimertinib
kosteneffectief is ten opzichte van actief volgen; de incrementele kosteneffectiviteitsratio (ICER) was 14.884 euro per
QALY ten opzichte van de relevante referentiewaarde van 50.000 euro per QALY. Onderbouwing Achtergrond Bij patiënten die
een volledige resectie hebben ondergaan van een niet-kleincellig longcarcinoom (stadium I- III) wordt in de MDO’s
gesproken over welke adjuvante therapie relevant is. Daarbij is de huidige (anno 2023) standaard om bij patiënten met
een stadium II-III adjuvant chemotherapie te geven. Inmiddels wordt er bij het uitgebreid of gemetastaseerd
longcarcinoom gekeken naar moleculaire veranderingen, omdat die impact hebben op de keuze van palliatieve therapie. De
vraag is in hoeverre het meten van zulke veranderingen relevant is voor de adjuvante setting en of dit
behandelconsequenties heeft. Hierbij is het van belang op te merken dat de studies over het algemeen zijn uitgevoerd
onder 5e-7e TNM editie. Voor het advies zal gebruik worden gemaakt van de 8e TNM editie. Conclusies Adjuvant
osimertinib* compared with placebo in patients who underwent completely resected, early-stage (IB to IIIA) pathological
confirmed EGFR+ NSCLC * Currently, osimertinib is the only available treatment in the Netherlands within the adjuvant
setting for patients with a completely resected, early-stage (I to III) pathological confirmed NSCLC harbouring a common
EGFR-mutation Osimertinib may increase 5-year overall survival (85%) when compared to placebo (73%). Low GRADE Sources:
(Tsuboi, 2023) Osimertinib may increase disease-free survival (median 68 months) when compared to placebo (median 28
months). Low GRADE Sources: (Wu, 2020; Herbst, 2023) QoL may not be substantially different with adjuvant osimertinib
when compared to placebo. Low GRADE Sources: (Majem, 2022) The evidence suggests that osimertinib results in more
patients (9 more per 100 treated patients) with adverse events grade 3 or higher when compared to placebo. Low GRADE
Sources: (Wu, 2020; Herbst, 2023) Other adjuvant treatments No evidence is available regarding the effect of other

patiënten met een initieel klinisch relevante respons op ICI, was de effectiviteit van rechallenge (ORR) tussen de 8,5%
en 52,4%. (Akamatsu, 2022; Cai, 2022; Herbst, 2022; Reck, 2021; Xu, 2022). Er zijn echter geen gerandomiseerde studies
die aantonen dat overlevingswinst optreedt. Beide behandelopties zijn ook in overeenstemming met internationale
richtlijnen (Hendriks, 2023). Professioneel perspectief Er zijn geen aanvullende overwegingen vanuit professioneel
perspectief naast bovengenoemde argumenten. Patiëntenperspectief Sommige patiënten staan open voor behandelingen
waarvoor geen direct bewijs is. Het is belangrijk voor patiënten om open communicatie te hebben met hun behandelaars en
volledig geïnformeerd te zijn over de voor- en nadelen van beschikbare behandelopties. Gezamenlijke besluitvorming
tussen patiënt en zorgverlener kan helpen om behandelingen te kiezen die passen bij de individuele situatie en
voorkeuren van de patiënt. Het patiëntenperspectief ondersteunt de aanbevelingen. Acceptatie, haalbaarheid,
implementatie De aanbeveling is reeds onderdeel van de standaard behandeling op dit moment. Daarom verwacht de werkgroep
geen problemen op het gebied van acceptatie, haalbaarheid en implementatie. Kosten De werkgroep heeft geen eindoordeel
over het middelenbeslag van de interventie, omdat deze behandeling al onderdeel is van de standaard zorg. Onderbouwing
Achtergrond A combination of platinum doublet chemotherapy (ChT) with immunotherapy (ICI) is the most common first
treatment approach in patients with an incurable NSCLC without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations (with PS 0-1 and
with no contraindications for ICI). It is recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD- L1≥50% with a smoking
history with single-agent ICI in the first-line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. For patients with
disease progression after combination ChT and ICI, the recommendations for subsequent treatment are not clear and there
is uncertainty about level of evidence for these recommendations. Before the introduction of ICI treatments, docetaxel
has shown improved OS compared with best supportive care (BSC) in second line treatment. Conclusies Overall survival,
progression-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life No evidence was found regarding the effects of
docetaxel compared with best supportive care or other chemotherapy (with or without other treatment) in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations after treatment with platinum doublet

otherapie (zowel ORR als PFS). In de eerstelijnsbehandeling zijn zowel alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib als ensartinib
(de laatste is niet verkrijgbaar in Nederland) met crizotinib vergeleken bij patiënten met een ALK rearrangement. De
verbetering in mediane PFS is klinisch relevant (HR < 0.7 en verbetering 16 weken of meer) en tevens is er door de
cerebrale penetratie van de nieuwere TKIs een betere controle van hersenmetastasen, of preventie van het ontstaan van
hersenmetastasen. De nieuwere TKIs zijn niet met elkaar vergeleken als eerstelijnsbehandeling, en het is op dit moment
niet duidelijk of eerst een tweede generatie ALK-TKI gevolgd door lorlatinib bij progressie, of direct eerste lijn
lorlatinib zorgt voor een betere overleving. Op basis van patiënt karakteristieken en het toxiciteitsprofiel kan gekozen
worden voor een specifieke nieuwere generatie ALK-TKI in de eerste lijn. Na progressie op een tweede of derde generatie
ALK-TKI kan er, afhankelijk van het resistentiepatroon en de eerder gegeven ALK-TKI, geswitcht worden naar een andere
ALK-TKI (te selecteren op basis van de specifieke gevonden ALK-mutatie) danwel (platinum-doublet) chemotherapie, danwel

alectinib) versus crizotinib on overall survival, objective response rate, adverse events, and quality of Life in
patients with non–small-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK-fusion. VERY LOW GRADE The evidence is very uncertain
about the effect of targeted therapy (crizotinib or ceritinib) versus chemotherapy on overall survival, objective
response rate, adverse events, and quality of life in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK-

brigatinib, lorlatinib, alectinib) versus crizotinib on objective response rate in patients with non–small- cell lung
cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK-fusion. VERY LOW Targeted therapy (crizotinib or ceritinib) may increase the objective

overwegingen volgt de werkgroep de overwegingen van de ESMO guideline (Hendriks, 2023), voor zover deze van toepassing
zijn in Nederland. Meerdere pan-HER TKIs, zoals afatinib, dacomitinib en neratinib, zijn geëvalueerd in kleine fase II
studies met teleurstellende resultaten (Jebbink, 2020). Poziotinib resulteerde in een ORR van 28% (95% CI 19% - 38%),
een mediane PFS van 5.5 maanden (95% CI 3.9-5.8 ) en een mediane duur van respons van 5.1 maanden (95% CI 4.2-5.5) in
een fase II studie waarin patiënten met voorbehandeld HER2 gemuteerd NSCLC werden geïncludeerd (N= 90) (Le, 2022). HER2
gerichte antibody drug conjugates (ADC) hebben veelbelovendere resultaten laten zien. Trastuzumab-emtansine is
geëvalueerd in een basket studie waarbij 19 voorbehandelde patiënten met een HER2 gemuteerd long adenocarcinoom werden
geïncludeerd (Li, 2019). ORR was 44% (95% CI 22-69%). Trastuzumab deruxtecan is geëvalueerd in de DESTINY LUNG-01 studie
waarin 91 patiënten met HER2 gemuteerd, voorbehandeld NSCLC warden geïncludeerd (Li, 2022). ORR was 55% (95% CI 44-65%),
mediane duur van respons was 9.3 maanden (95% CI 5.7-14.7). Belangrijk is dat interstitieel longlijden geïnduceerd door
de medicatie optrad in 26% van de patiënten en resulteerde in de dood van twee patiënten. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is FDA
en EMA goedgekeurd maar is buiten een klinische studie niet verkrijgbaar in Nederland. De andere medicijnen zijn niet
goedgekeurd. Onderbouwing Conclusies - There are no RCTs that compared targeted therapy with chemotherapy in patients
with GRADE NSCLC and a HER2 mutation/aberration. Samenvatting literatuur A systematic review that reviewed clinical
outcomes after targeted therapy or chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with a HER2 mutation was included in this literature
analysis. Description of studies Wu (2022) performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to investigate the
efficacy of targeted therapy in HER2-positive NSCLC patients. The literature search covered the period from inception to
May 30, 2021. The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), single-arm and cohort studies; trials conducted
in HER2-positive patients with NSCLC; and (3) studies reporting on the objective response rate (ORR), disease control
rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Exclusion criteria were: Patients who received prior chemotherapy,
surgery, radiotherapy anti-HER2 therapy, or other targeted therapies within four weeks before the first dose of the
medication of interest; patients admitted for other medical problems; trials on pregnant women, reviews, editorials,
case reports, congress articles and articles unrelated to subject of the study. In total, 32 studies were included. Of
these 32 studies, 4 were RCTs, 11 Cohort studies, 17 Single-arm studies, 1 phase I, and 15 phase II. For more details
about the included studies, please see Wu (2022). The four RCTs (Gandhi, 2017; Gatzemeier, 2004; Hotta, 2017; Lara,

plus ipilimumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage
IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations. In practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to
accelerate the effect. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is restricted to the CheckMate 9LA results in which the
intervention consists of nivolumab, ipilimumab and chemotherapy and the control of chemotherapy alone. Overall survival

months (95% CI: 7.7-13.7) in the CT group (89 events/129 patients) in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of
8.1 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.85) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group.
This difference was considered clinically relevant. In the 2-year update, the median OS in patients with a PD-L1
expression level of <1% was 17.7 months (95% CI: 13.7-20.3) in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 9.8 months (95%
CI: 7.7-13.5) in the CT group with a minimum follow-up of 24.4 months (Reck, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% CI:
0.51 to 0.88) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group. This difference was considered clinically relevant. The 2023
ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an OS rate of 23% for the dual immunotherapy plus CT group versus

START-trial, were put on hold for enrolment and treatment after a case of encephalitis occurred in a phase 2 trial of
tecemotide for multiple myeloma. Subsequent investigations of this patient, an overall safety analysis of the use of
tecemotide in non-small-cell lung cancer and introduction of safety measures by protocol amendment led to the clinical
hold being lifted in June, 2010. Adverse events of any cause and grade occurred in 938 (91.6%) patients in the
tecemotide group versus 432 (90.6%) in the placebo group (RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.05)). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of
any cause occurred in 342 (33.4%) patients in the tecemotide group versus 171 (35.8%) in the placebo group (RR 0.93 (95%
CI 0.80 to 1.08)). Treatment related adverse events of any grade occurred in 353 (34%) patients in the tecemotide group
versus 129 (27%) in the placebo group (RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.51)). Treatment related grade 3 or 4 adverse events
occurred in 15 (1%) patients in the tecemotide group versus 5 (1%) in the placebo group (RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.82)).
Adverse events leading to death occurred in 46 patients (4%) who received tecemotide and in 35 patients (7%) who
received placebo (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.40, 0.94)). Level of evidence comparison tecemotide versus placebo There are four
levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of
evidence for the outcomes overall survival and adverse events was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of
violation of the intent to treat analysis, 274 patients were excluded from the primary analysis population as a result
of a clinical hold (risk of bias) and 2 levels for imprecision (total number of patients < 2000 per group, wide 95%
confidence intervals and overlap with the border of clinical relevance). As the included study did not report data on
progression free survival, response rate and quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of evidence.

a concurrent ipilimumab regimen with carboplatin/paclitaxel a phased ipilimumab regimen with carboplatin/paclitaxel and
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone and included both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC patients. Govindan (2017) only included
squamous NSCLC patients who were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel plus blinded ipilimumab

he study enrolled patients at 148 academic and community centres in 22 countries. In the intervention arm 171 patients
received treatment with Sotorasib 960 mg orally once daily. In the control arm 174 patients received Docetaxel 75 mg/m²
intravenously every 3 weeks. The study reported the following outcomes: progression free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), overall response rate, safety, and patient reported outcomes (PROs). The median duration of follow-up was
17.7 months (IQR 16.4–20.1). NCT01395758 – Gerber (2018) studied patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic
NSCLC harboring a KRAS mutation, who received prior chemotherapy, in an open-label, randomized phase 2 trial. The study
enrolled patients at 11 medical centers in the United States. In the intervention arm patients received erlotinib (150
mg orally daily at least 1 hour prior to and at least 2 hours after ingestion of food) in combination with tivantinib
(360 mg orally twice daily with meals). In the control arm patients received investigator’s choice chemotherapy
(gemcitabine 1250mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days, or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1
every 21 days). The study reported the following outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS),
overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). The median duration of follow-up was 3.4 months. Study results
Overall survival - Critical outcome Two of the two included studies reported on overall survival (OS). De Langen (2023)
reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on OS as secondary endpoint. The study was not powered for OS.
Treatment with sotorasib resulted in similar OS compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.77–1.33). This
difference was not considered clinically relevant. Median OS was 10·6 months (95% CI 8·9–14·0) for patients in the
sotorasib arm and 11·3 months (95% CI 9·0–14·9) for patients in the docetaxel arm. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of
erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on OS. Median OS was 6.8 months for patients in the erlotinib-tivantinib arm
and 8.5 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.76–1.88; P=0.44). This difference was not
considered clinically relevant. Progression free survival - Important outcome Two of the two included studies reported
on progression free survival (PFS). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on PFS. Treatment
with sotorasib resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 0·66;
95% CI: 0·51–0·86). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4·3–7·8) in the sotorasib arm and 4·5 months (3·0–5·7) in the
docetaxel arm. The 12-month PFS was 24·8% for sotorasib versus 10·1% for docetaxel. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of
erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on PFS. Treatment with erlotinib-tivantinib resulted in a similar PFS compared
to treatment with chemotherapy. Median PFS was 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.6–5.6) for patients treated with erlotinib-
tivantinib and 4.3 months (95% CI: 1.6–5.8 months) for those treated with chemotherapy (HR 1.19; 95% CI: 0.71–1.97).

Relevant outcome measures The guideline development group considered overall survival as a critical outcome measure for
decision making, whereas disease/event-free survival, response rate, adverse events and quality of life were considered
as important outcome measures for decision making. A priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures
listed above but used the definitions used in the studies. The working group defined the following minimal clinically
(patient) important differences. For these definitions, the PASKWIL criteria for adjuvant treatment  were used where
possible, since there are no specific criteria for neoadjuvant therapy): Overall survival: >5% difference between the
groups or >3% difference and HR <0.7, at least three years of median follow-up time Disease-free survival: HR <0.6
Event-free survival: not described (not defined by PASKWIL) Response rate (for neoadjuvant treatment): major
pathological response (MPR), pathological complete response (pCR) Adverse events: absolute difference <5% for lethal
complications, or <25% for serious complications Quality of life: A minimal clinically important difference of 10 points
on the quality-of-life instrument EORTC QLQ-C30 or a difference of a similar magnitude on similar, validated quality of
life instruments Search and select (Methods) The systematic review published by Wang (2022) was used to retrieve
relevant RCTs. Wang searched PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase with relevant search terms until November 2021. The
detailed search strategy is depicted in the supplemental methods (Wang, 2022). Four of the 52 included studies were
considered eligible (NEOSTAR, CheckMate 816, IMpower010, PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091). On the 24th of February 2023, we performed
a systematic search for systematic reviews and RCTs about early non-small cell lung cancer and immunotherapy in the
databases Embase.com and Ovid/Medline. The search resulted in 223 unique hits and we screened publications published
after the search date of Wang (2022). This search yielded one additional RCT (NCT02904954). On the 3rd of October 2023,
the systematic search was updated with systematic reviews and RCTs published from the 24th of February 2023. The search
resulted in 104 unique extra hits. This search yielded five additional RCTs (KEYNOTE-671, NADIM-II, TD-FOREKNOW,
NeoCOAST, NCT03110978). An overview of all excluded and ongoing trials was added as a supplement. Results published in
abstracts are described in the considerations, awaiting peer-reviewed publication. One publication was added to the body
of evidence (Felip 2022), because it was considered to be a unique contribution for assessing the effect of neoadjuvant
immunotherapy. This conference abstract described quality of life data of the CheckMate 816 trial not mentioned
elsewhere. Results A total of ten studies was included in the analysis of the literature: six for neoadjuvant

survival and disease-free survival as critical outcome measures for decision making; and quality of life and toxicity as
important outcome measures for decision making. A priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed

belangrijkste factor, vooral voor het kleincellig longcarcinoom en het plaveiselcelcarcinoom. Voor adenocarcinomen is
naast roken luchtverontreiniging een belangrijke bijdragende factor. Volgens een grote Europese studie is het
longcarcinoom risico geassocieerd met luchtverontreiniging (HR 1,22; 95% BI., 1,03-1,45) per 10 μg/m3 toename in PM .
Dat risico is lager dan het risico door roken waarvoor het relatieve risico 23,3 en 12,7 is voor respectievelijk de
huidige mannelijke en vrouwelijke rokers [Raaschou-Nielsen 2013(9)]. Toch is het totale risico door luchtverontreiniging
groot, gezien het feit dat iedereen hieraan is blootgesteld. De risico’s op longcarcinoom in Nederland zijn voor 80 tot
85% aan roken gerelateerd en voor tenminste 8% aan fijnstof, in het bijzonder bij de adenocarcinomen [WHO 2009; Beelen

longcarcinoom? Aanbeveling Longcarcinoom screening wordt geadviseerd bij hoog-risico groepen, door centra die beschikken
over een low-dose CT en specifieke software. Daarnaast moeten er kennis en competenties voor screening aanwezig zijn.
Stoppen met roken is een integraal onderdeel van screening. Overwegingen Er zijn sterke aanwijzingen dat met beter
definiëren van het risico profiel van een nodus de aanvullende diagnostiek beperkt kan worden. Ook zijn er aanwijzingen
vanuit de NELSON-trial dat er minder follow-up diagnostiek noodzakelijk is dan in de NLST-trial. Dat wil zeggen dat de
kosteneffectiviteit zal verbeteren en de stralenbelasting zal afnemen. De United States Preventive Services Task Force
beveelt jaarlijkse screening aan met een low-dose CT voor de leeftijdscategorie 55 - 80 jaar met 30 pack years en roker
zijn of in de afgelopen 15 jaar zijn gestopt met roken. Screening moet worden gestopt als er 15 jaar niet is gerookt of
als er een gezondheidsprobleem ontstaat waarbij de levensverwachting beperkt is en een curatieve long chirurgie niet
meer mogelijk is. Deze definitie wijkt slechts in geringe mate af van de inclusie-criteria van de NELSON-studie. Een
andere manier om de risicogroep te definiëren komt vanuit het Liverpool Lung Project (LLP). In dit model worden
toegevoegd de leeftijd, pack years, geslacht, passief roken, pneumonie, asbest contact en familiegeschiedenis. Bij
eventuele screening van rokers is het van belang om tegelijkertijd veel aandacht te besteden aan stoppen met roken. Deze

Rizvi (2020) – MYSTIC described a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center phase III trial, with a median
follow-up of 30.2 months. They evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus
durvalumab alone versus chemotherapy in patients with treatment-naive, metastatic (stage IV) non–small cell lung cancer
who had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK genetic alterations. A total of 1118 patients was randomized to receive durvalumab
(20 mg/kg every 4 weeks) plus tremelimumab (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses), or durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4

Currently, treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in the
Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations. In practice,
immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the effect. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is
restricted to the CheckMate 9LA results in which the intervention consists of nivolumab, ipilimumab and chemotherapy and
the control of chemotherapy alone. Overall survival (critical) PD-L1 <1%* In patients with a PD-L1 expression level of

patients) in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.62
(95% CI: 0.45 to 0.85) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group. This difference was considered clinically relevant. In
the 2-year update, the median OS in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1% was 17.7 months (95% CI: 13.7-20.3) in
the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 9.8 months (95% CI: 7.7-13.5) in the CT group with a minimum follow-up of 24.4
months (Reck, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.88) in favor of the dual immunotherapy group. This
difference was considered clinically relevant. The 2023 ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an OS rate

Achtergrond A combination of platinum doublet chemotherapy (ChT) with immunotherapy (ICI) is the most common first
treatment approach in patients with an incurable NSCLC without sensitizing oncogene driver mutations (with PS 0-1 and
with no contraindications for ICI). It is recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD- L1≥50% with a smoking
history with single-agent ICI in the first-line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. For patients with
disease progression after combination ChT and ICI, the recommendations for subsequent treatment are not clear and there
is uncertainty about level of evidence for these recommendations. Before the introduction of ICI treatments, docetaxel
has shown improved OS compared with best supportive care (BSC) in second line treatment. Conclusies Overall survival,

priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above but used the definitions used in the studies.
The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important differences. For these definitions, the
PASKWIL criteria for adjuvant treatment https://www.nvmo.org/over-de-adviezen/ were used where possible, since there are
no specific criteria for neoadjuvant therapy):|| Row 4: || Row 5: |Overall survival: >5% difference between the groups
or >3% difference and HR <0.7, at least three years of median follow-up time| Row 6: |Disease-free survival: HR <0.6|
Row 7: |Event-free survival: not described (not defined by PASKWIL)| Row 8: |Response rate (for neoadjuvant treatment):
major pathological response (MPR), pathological complete response (pCR)| Row 9: |Adverse events: absolute difference <5%

patiënttherapietrouw spelen ook een rol. Om de implementatie te verbeteren, kan coördinatie tussen lokale
zorginstellingen en gespecialiseerde regionale TKI-centra, waarheen patiënten verwezen kunnen worden, uitkomst bieden.
