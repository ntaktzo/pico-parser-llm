placebo in deze setting. Deze studie liet klinische relevante voordelen zien: osimertinib verhoogt wellicht de
5-jaarsoverleving (85%) in vergelijking met placebo (73%) (Tsuboi, 2023) en resulteert wellicht in een
aanzienlijk langere ziektevrije overleving en betere CNS controle. Na 24 maanden was 89% van de patiënten
in leven en ziektevrij in de osimertinib groep, terwijl dit 52% was in de placebo groep (Wu, 2022). Op basis

Low
GRADE Sources: (Tsuboi, 2023)
Osimertinib may increase disease-free survival (median 68 months) when compared to
placebo (median 28 months).
Low
GRADE
Sources: (Wu, 2020; Herbst, 2023)
QoL may not be substantially different with adjuvant osimertinib when compared to
placebo.
Low
GRADE
Sources: (Majem, 2022)
The evidence suggests that osimertinib results in more patients (9 more per 100 treated
patients) with adverse events grade 3 or higher when compared to placebo.

an EGFR-mutation. A total of 682 patients were randomized to receive osimertinib (n=339) (80 mg once daily)
or placebo (n=343) for 36 months. The median age (range) was 64 (30-86) in the osimertinib group compared
