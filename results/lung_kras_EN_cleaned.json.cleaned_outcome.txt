platinum-doublet chemotherapy (see section 3.2). People took 960 mg
sotorasib (8 tablets of 120 mg) once a day until disease progression,
treatment discontinuation or the end of the study. The primary outcome
of the trial was an objective response rate of 37.1% (95% confidence
interval 28.6 to 46.2), with the latest data-cut from March 2021. A pre-
specified clinical significance benchmark of the lower bound of the 95%

independent central review per RECIST 1.1 criteria. The company noted
that CodeBreaK100 was not specifically powered for overall and
progression-free survival outcomes, but it was powered for the primary
outcome. The committee acknowledged that the clinical evidence from
the CodeBreaK100 trial is relevant. An indirect comparison is appropriate because there are

trials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in
CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the
proportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to
CodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in
conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including
KRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the
company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival
are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and

that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company
identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1,
resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free
survival base-case utility. As a result, the company determined that
scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04
progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were
appropriate to explore. The committee concluded that it would consider

earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company
suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is
anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that
support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an
effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and
26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG
preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company

committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded
that there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling,

who were alive will have kept taking sotorasib at that point. Because
sotorasib is taken until progression or unacceptable toxicity in
CodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning could lead to biased
cost-effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was
