earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company
suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is
anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that
support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an
effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and
26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG
preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company
disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lu

The company
disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The
committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded
that there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling,
and that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate. Treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years from the start of
treatment are plausible

survival to be implemented into the hazard function, and therefore,

action and response rate would be different. The ERG disagreed with th
company's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued benefit
and highlighted that the evidence is still immature. In its base case, the
ERG preferred to apply treatment effect waning at 2 years and graduall
decrease the hazard ratio to 1 over 5 years. This was considered
optimistic by the ERG. In addition, the ERG carried out additional scenar
analyses with treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years after starting
treatment with no gradual decrease in the hazard ratio. Thi

independent central review per RECIST 1.1 criteria. The company noted
that CodeBreaK100 was not specifically powered for overall and
progression-free survival outcomes, but it was powered for the primary
outcome. The committee acknowledged that the clinical evidence from
the CodeBreaK100 trial is relevant. An indirect comparison is appropriate because there are

eted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged
that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company
identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1,
resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free
survival base-case utility. As a result, the company determined that
scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04
progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were
appropriate to explore. The committee concluded that it would consider
both a disutility and no disutility associated with intravenou
