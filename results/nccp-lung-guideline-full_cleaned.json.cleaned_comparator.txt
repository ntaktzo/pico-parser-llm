Analysis of SBRT/SABR outcomes in 676 patients found a median OS of 40.7 months, and actuarial 5-year
rates of initial local, regional and distant recurrence of 10.5%, 12.7% and 19.9%, respectively (Senthi et

the outcomes of different modality therapies, but also to better define patients considered at high risk.
(Ambrogi et al., 2015)
There is some evidence to show radiofrequency ablation can achieve local tumour control in patients
with clinical stage Ia tumours; however there are no published studies that determine its utility compared
to other management strategies and further clinical trials comparing RFA to other local therapies are
therefore needed. Every patient with early stage disease (T1-T2 N0 M0) should

in 20 fractions with a BED of 70.13 Gy this would mean an average increase to a BED of 83.3 Gy . Some
studies suggest that an increase in absolute dose of 1 Gy is associated with a 3% reduction in death (Kong
et al., 2005). By optimising dose prescription, potential gains for the patient in tumour control probability
(TCP) can be realised while balancing the risk of acceptable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)
(Machtay et al., 2012). Mean Lung Dose (MLD) was lower for 19/20 of 4D planned cases, with an average

and mathematical modelling. However, when individual characteristics are incorporated, this gain may be
less evident in terms of survival and dyspnoea rates.
4DCT allows potential for isotoxic dose escalation, which may lead to improved local control and better
overall survival. (Cole et al., 2014)
Mean follow-up times in the 4DCT/IMRT and CT/3DCRT groups were 1.3 (range, 0.1–3.2) and 2.1 (range,
0.1–7.9) years, respectively. The hazard ratios for 4DCT/IMRT were <1 for all disease end points; the

NTCP were modelled using the Lyman–Kutcher–Burman (LKB) model. This was compared with a predictive

followed patients for six months. The results of the RCT are combined with quality of life data gathered

had depressive symptoms (16% vs. 38%, p=0.01). Despite the fact that fewer patients in the early palliative
care group than in the standard care group received aggressive end-of-life care (33% vs. 54%, p=0.05),
median survival was longer among patients receiving early palliative care (11.6 months vs. 8.9 months,
p=0.02). While a survival benefit from early involvement of palliative care has not yet been demonstrated
