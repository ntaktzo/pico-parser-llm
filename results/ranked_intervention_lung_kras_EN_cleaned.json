3.10 Sotorasib is an oral targeted treatment. It is more tolerable and less
resource intensive than chemotherapy. The clinical expert described the
issues associated with intravenous treatments, such as adverse events
and delays in treatment because of capacity issues in chemotherapy
units, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The clinical expert
highlighted the benefits of oral treatment from an NHS and patient
perspective, and the preference for it. The patient expert described the
benefits of having treatment at home and reduc

3.2 The clinical experts explained that most people with untreated locally
advanced or metastatic NSCLC would be offered immunotherapy with
chemotherapy. Treatment with docetaxel or docetaxel plus nintedanib
may be offered if the disease progresses. The clinical lead for the Canc
Drugs Fund highlighted that of all people with untreated locally advance
or metastatic NSCLC who have immunotherapy, about 40% have
immunotherapy alone rather than with chemotherapy.

supplementary analysis of sotorasib versus docetaxel was also done
using a propensity score weighting analysis (PSWA) approach, using da
from CodeBreaK100 for sotorasib and the chemotherapy arm of the
Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence study. The committee
concluded that an indirect treatment comparison is appropriate becaus
there are no head-to-head trials, but noted there were several issues
with the comparisons that introduced considerable uncertainty.
