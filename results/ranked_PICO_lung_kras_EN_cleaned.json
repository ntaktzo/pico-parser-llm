arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it
appropriate to stop. Current treatment for previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive, locally advanced or
metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer includes docetaxel or docetaxel plus nintedanib. Sotorasib is a targeted treatment
for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest
that, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people
live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end
of life. But there is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective, but more
evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib
is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary clinical trial and from an ongoing randomised
controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may
resolve some uncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund. © NICE

progression-free survival, and health-related quality of life. It will also collect data from people with previously

with longer follow-up data from CodeBreaK100 on mean overall and progression-free survival, and direct comparative

judgement issues were identified. Sotorasib has a novel mechanism of action in this treatment but all benefits are

treatment option for previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The committee
considered the innovative nature of sotorasib (see section 3.1). It agreed that sotorasib could be considered an
important treatment option for this population. The committee concluded that it did not think there were any additional

recommended only if the conditions in the managed access agreement for sotorasib are followed. 1.2 This recommendation
is not intended to affect treatment with sotorasib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published.
People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for
them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop. Current
treatment for previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
includes docetaxel or docetaxel plus nintedanib. Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib
has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest that, after platinum-based chemotherapy,
sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment.
Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But there is uncertainty in
the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective, but more evidence is needed to address the
uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is

therefore it was more immature. The ERG noted that the health-state utility approach means that each health state is
populated with more people. The committee noted that for a health- state utility approach, the proportion of people in
the progressed state that are closer to death are not apparent because averages are taken. The clinical expert
highlighted that people need to be well enough to assess quality of life after progression. Therefore, the average is
more likely representing people who recently stopped treatment. The committee considered that if a randomised controlled
trial was done, the health-related quality of life in both arms should be the same at the start of treatment. Therefore,
this may need to be considered in the approach to modelling health-related quality of life in the future. The company
mentioned that it is open to using health-state utilities if there is a difference for sotorasib compared with
chemotherapy after progression. The committee concluded that there are uncertainties in using time-to- death and health-
state utilities, but because both approaches may be plausible, it would consider these in its decision-making. Sotorasib
is an oral treatment with associated benefits, and a disutility for the comparative intravenous treatment may be
plausible 3.10 Sotorasib is an oral targeted treatment. It is more tolerable and less resource intensive than
chemotherapy. The clinical expert described the issues associated with intravenous treatments, such as adverse events
and delays in treatment because of capacity issues in chemotherapy units, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
clinical expert highlighted the benefits of oral treatment from an NHS and patient perspective, and the preference for
it. The patient expert described the benefits of having treatment at home and reducing inpatient time at the hospital.
The company applied a utility decrement of 0.025 per cycle of treatment to account for the cytotoxicity and intravenous

highlighted the lack of justification for the size of disutility. It also considered the exclusion of any potential
disutility associated with sotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets
once a day compared with docetaxel that is administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company
assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It
acknowledged that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company identified a progression-free survival

but there is currently no targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. People with KRAS G12C mutation-positive locally

affect health-related quality of life. The clinical expert highlighted that people with KRAS G12C mutation-positive
NSCLC have a poor prognosis. The clinical and patient experts noted that there is an unmet need for effective and
tolerable treatments in this population. They also highlighted that the lack of targeted treatment options can have a
psychological impact. This condition is associated with difficult- to-treat symptoms, and the patient expert submission
emphasised the psychological impact of these on patients and their carers. The clinical and patient experts stated that
a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation in NSCLC would be welcomed. The committee concluded that there is an

people with untreated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC would be offered immunotherapy with chemotherapy. Treatment
with docetaxel or docetaxel plus nintedanib may be offered if the disease progresses. The clinical lead for the Canc
Drugs Fund highlighted that of all people with untreated locally advance or metastatic NSCLC who have immunotherapy,
about 40% have immunotherapy alone rather than with chemotherapy. In this population platinum-doublet chemotherapy would
be offered at disease progression, or through a clinical trial, before docetaxel or docetaxel plu nintedanib is
considered. In its submission, the company chose to only compare sotorasib with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib.
No evidence was provided to compare sotorasib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The company explained that 90% of
people in the CodeBreaK100 trial (see section 3.3) had previously had platinum- doublet chemotherapy. Also, a
retrospective UK analysis supported tha most people who recently had docetaxel had likely had previous immunotherapy and
platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The company stated that sotorasib is positioned in the treatment pathway after platinum-
based chemotherapy. The clinical expert explained that platinum-doublet chemotherapy, either with or without
immunotherapy is usually the main treatment choice. The committee concluded that sotorasib is positioned after platinum-

plained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that
the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron
Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there
was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for
13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in
this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative.
The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because
the trial population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent trial. The committee recognised
that there are substantial uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis using SELECT-1 for
the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making. Docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi hazard ratio
of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate 3.7 In the secondary indirect treatment comparison of sotorasib versus
docetaxel plus nintedanib, the ERG highlighted uncertainties in the modelling. The company modelled docetaxel and
nintedanib in line with NICE's technology appraisal on nintedanib for previously treated locally © NICE 2024. All rights
reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P ing a advanced, metastatic, or locally recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.
This was because a company-sourced UK advisory board confirmed that a MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG
highlighted the uncertainty with not applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking status when these differed in SELECT-1
and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the Kaplan–Meier curve
in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in mortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a
worse survival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone. The Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight
benefit of docetaxel compared with docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then transformed into a
greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in the modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert
mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first
6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment
earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a possible explanation of the curve
could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth.
Therefore, it can take more time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this did not show a good fit.
Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed with invalidating LUME-

disutility associated with sotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets
once a day compared with docetaxel that is administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company
assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It
acknowledged that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company identified a progression-free survival
utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1, resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free survival base-
case utility. As a result, the company determined that scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025
or 0.04 progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were appropriate to explore. The committee concluded
that it would consider both a disutility and no disutility associated with intravenous administration in its decision-
making. It is appropriate to apply an equalised relative dose intensity sotorasib and its comparators 3.11 The company
applied a relative dose intensity that was lower for sotorasib (89.0%) compared with docetaxel (90.3%) and nintedanib

sotorasib, and any differences may be from random sampling errors. The ERG suggested it was reasonable to apply an
average 90.5% relative dose intensity instead. The ERG preferred this conservative approach because of the impact on
treatment costs and the immaturity of trial data. The company disagreed with equalised relative dose intensity because
it considered the trial data more valid. The clinical expert mentioned that the dose of sotorasib can be modified

Sotorasib for previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell 1.1 Sotorasib is recommended for
use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating KRAS G12C mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic
non-small-cell lung cancer in adults whose disease has progressed on, or who cannot tolerate, platinum-based
chemotherapy or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. It is recommended only if the conditions in the managed access agreement
for sotorasib are followed. 1.2 This recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with sotorasib that was started
in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without
change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS
clinician consider it appropriate to stop. Current treatment for previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive, locally
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer includes docetaxel or docetaxel plus nintedanib. Sotorasib is a
targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The
results suggest that, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and
how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending
treatment at the end of life. But there is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost
effective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The
evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary clinical trial and from an
ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer
Drugs Fund may resolve some uncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer
Drugs Fund. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 4 of 2.1 Sotorasib (Lumykras, Amgen) is

submitted by Amgen, a review of thi submission by the evidence review group (ERG), and responses from stakeholders. the
committee papers for full details of the evidence. There is a high unmet need for targeted treatments for KRAS G12C
mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCL 3.1 The KRAS oncogene is the most commonly mutated gene in lung
cancer. The KRAS G12C mutation is the most common and occurs in 12% of non- small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours in
the UK. This mutation is more common in non-squamous NSCLC and does not usually occur with other known mutations such as
EGFR, ALK and ROS-1. These other known mutations may have targeted treatments available but there is currently no
targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. People with KRAS G12C mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic
NSCLC usually have chemotherapy, a non-targeted treatment associated with adverse effects that affect health-related
quality of life. The clinical expert highlighted that people with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC have a poor
prognosis. The clinical and patient experts noted that there is an unmet need for effective and tolerable treatments in
this population. They also highlighted that the lack of targeted treatment options can have a psychological impact. This
condition is associated with difficult- to-treat symptoms, and the patient expert submission emphasised the
psychological impact of these on patients and their carers. The clinical and patient experts stated that a targeted
treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation in NSCLC would be welcomed. The committee concluded that there is an unmet need for
targeted treatments for KRAS G12C mutation- positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and that these would have

e could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth.
Therefore, it can take more time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this did not show a good fit.
Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed with invalidating LUME-
Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded that there are
uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling, and that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is
appropriate. Treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years from the start of treatment are plausible 3.8 The company did not
apply treatment effect waning because it considered the impact of discontinuation on overall and progression-free
survival to be implemented into the hazard function, and therefore, © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice

CodeBreaK100 March 2021 data-cut, 81.7% of people had discontinued treatment, about 40% were alive and about 20% had not
yet progressed. The company stated that half the people who were alive will have kept taking sotorasib at that point.
Because sotorasib is taken until progression or unacceptable toxicity in CodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning
could lead to biased cost-effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was difficult to know how the
treatment effect waning should be applied for sotorasib. However, they suggested that sotorasib should be considere in a
similar way to other oral treatments for NSCLC. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund referred to an example of
oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors showing high response rates. They noted that the disease ca progress and people remain
relatively well for some time before having symptoms. The clinical expert agreed with this. The company highlighte that
sotorasib is not a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and that its mechanism o action and response rate would be different. The
ERG disagreed with th company's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued benefit and highlighted that the
evidence is still immature. In its base case, the ERG preferred to apply treatment effect waning at 2 years and graduall
decrease the hazard ratio to 1 over 5 years. This was considered optimistic by the ERG. In addition, the ERG carried out
additional scenar analyses with treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years after starting treatment with no gradual
decrease in the hazard ratio. This is in line w some other NSCLC appraisals. The committee noted that no direct trial
evidence after the latest follow up at 15 months means that the treatment effect beyond this period is uncertain. The
committee concluded that applying treatment effect waning 3 years and 5 years from the start of treatment may be
plausible and it would consider thes in its decision-making. Utility value estimates using the time-to-death and healt
approaches may be plausible 3.9 The company used time-to-death utilities in its base case and used health-state

compared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib. The unanchored MAIC using SELECT-1 data is appropriat decision-
making but has substantial uncertainty 3.6 The company chose 4 covariates in the primary MAIC analysis for matching:

matched to SELECT-1 (the exact results are confidential and cannot be © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to
Notice of rights small ata se in th y or n th t nt te fo and- he or e 9 of reported here). Some covariates identified as
'very important' by clinical experts were excluded from matching by the company because of missing data or trial
differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain metastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The
company mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the trials. The proportion of people with brain
metastases was higher in CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the proportion of inactive brain
metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to CodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in conservative
results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including KRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged
the company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival are similar in the absence of targeted
therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have been possible
to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using
a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was
adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little difference in the
effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain
metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a
PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative. The committee agreed that using
SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial population was more
comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial
uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis using SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for
decision-making. Docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months
is appropriate 3.7 In the secondary indirect treatment comparison of sotorasib versus docetaxel plus nintedanib, the ERG
highlighted uncertainties in the modelling. The company modelled docetaxel and nintedanib in line with NICE's technology

targeted therapies, real-world evidence studies suggest less than 10 months overall survival with second-line treatment
and less than 7 months overall survival with third-line treatment. This was supported with a median overall survival of
7.9 months in SELECT-1 and median overall survival of 10.9 months in LUME-Lung 1. The committee accepted that sotorasib
meets the short life expectancy criterion for end of life. It noted a median overall survival gain from the indirect
treatment comparisons of sotorasib with docetaxel alone (see section 3.5) from the latest March 2021 data-cut, at around

platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The company explained that 90% of people in the CodeBreaK100 trial (see section 3.3) had
previously had platinum- doublet chemotherapy. Also, a retrospective UK analysis supported tha most people who recently
had docetaxel had likely had previous immunotherapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The company stated that sotorasib
is positioned in the treatment pathway after platinum-based chemotherapy. The clinical expert explained that platinum-
doublet chemotherapy, either with or without immunotherapy is usually the main treatment choice. The committee concluded
that sotorasib is positioned after platinum-based chemotherapy, therefore docetaxel monotherapy and docetaxel plus
nintedanib are the relevant comparators. The clinical evidence for sotorasib is from CodeBreaK100 phase 2, single-arm

Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). The company has expressed an interest in the technology being considered for
funding through the mentioned that sotorasib needs to have plausible potential to be cost effective. The committee
acknowledged that some of the clinical uncertainty may be addressed by collecting data on sotorasib through CodeBreaK200
trial, comparing sotorasib with docetaxel in a KRAS G12C mutation-positive population, is currently ongoing. It stated
that this trial will measure overall and progression-free survival, and health-related quality of life. It will also
collect data from people with previously treated disease. The committee agreed that some uncertainty may be resolved
with data from the CodeBreak200 trial. The committee recalled its conclusion that the current cost-effectiveness results
were highly uncertain. It agreed that, with longer follow-up data from CodeBreaK100 on mean overall and progression-free
survival, and direct comparative evidence with docetaxel from CodeBreaK200, sotorasib has the potential to be cost
effective. Also, that additional evidence may change the preferred modelling assumptions outlined in section 3.13. The

h docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then transformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit
for docetaxel in the modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert mentioned that in clinical practice,
docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also
highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment earlier, but added that this is
unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is
anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more
time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG suggested using 1 cut-off point
at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard
ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The
committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded that there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus
nintedanib modelling, and that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate. Treatment effect waning at 3
and 5 years from the start of treatment are plausible 3.8 The company did not apply treatment effect waning because it

of people had discontinued treatment, about 40% were alive and about 20% had not yet progressed. The company stated that
half the people who were alive will have kept taking sotorasib at that point. Because sotorasib is taken until
progression or unacceptable toxicity in CodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning could lead to biased cost-
effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was difficult to know how the treatment effect waning
should be applied for sotorasib. However, they suggested that sotorasib should be considere in a similar way to other
oral treatments for NSCLC. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund referred to an example of oral tyrosine kinase
inhibitors showing high response rates. They noted that the disease ca progress and people remain relatively well for
some time before having symptoms. The clinical expert agreed with this. The company highlighte that sotorasib is not a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor and that its mechanism o action and response rate would be different. The ERG disagreed with
th company's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued benefit and highlighted that the evidence is still
immature. In its base case, the ERG preferred to apply treatment effect waning at 2 years and graduall decrease the

health-state utilities if there is a difference for sotorasib compared with chemotherapy after progression. The
committee concluded that there are uncertainties in using time-to- death and health-state utilities, but because both
approaches may be plausible, it would consider these in its decision-making. Sotorasib is an oral treatment with
associated benefits, and a disutility for the comparative intravenous treatment may be plausible 3.10 Sotorasib is an
oral targeted treatment. It is more tolerable and less resource intensive than chemotherapy. The clinical expert
described the issues associated with intravenous treatments, such as adverse events and delays in treatment because of
capacity issues in chemotherapy units, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The clinical expert highlighted the
benefits of oral treatment from an NHS and patient perspective, and the preference for it. The patient expert described
the benefits of having treatment at home and reducing inpatient time at the hospital. The company applied a utility
decrement of 0.025 per cycle of treatment to account for the cytotoxicity and intravenous administration of docetaxel
and nintedanib. This was based on a study comparing © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P a
erlotinib with docetaxel in advanced NSCLC (Lewis et al., 2010). The utilities in that study were derived through a
visual analogue scale in the progression-free health state. The ERG noted that the utilities (0.451 and 0.426 for oral
and intravenous therapy, respectively) in that study were lower than in CodeBreaK100 (0.734). The ERG said it was not
opposed to a treatment-related disutility for intravenous administration but highlighted the lack of justification for
the size of disutility. It also considered the exclusion of any potential disutility associated with sotorasib dosing
and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets once a day compared with docetaxel that is
administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company assumed equal on-treatment progression-
free survival utilities for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged that a differential is seen
in other NICE appraisals. The company identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1,
resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free survival base-case utility. As a result, the
company determined that scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04 progression-free
survival on-treatment utility differential were appropriate to explore. The committee concluded that it would consider
both a disutility and no disutility associated with intravenous administration in its decision-making. It is appropriate

intensity that was lower for sotorasib (89.0%) compared with docetaxel (90.3%) and nintedanib (92.1%). The company

the indirect treatmen comparisons show a survival benefit with sotorasib compared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus

The company chose 4 covariates in the primary MAIC analysis for matching: ECOG performance score, mean age, metastatic
disease at baseline and smoking status. These covariates were all perfectly matched to SELECT-1 (the exact results are

excluded from matching by the company because of missing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain
metastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The company mentioned that active brain metastasis was
excluded from the trials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1.
The company stated that if the proportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to CodeBreaK100, any bias
would favour the docetaxel arm and result in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including KRAS
mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the company's reasoning that overall survival and
progression-free survival are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS G12C-specific
population. However, it explained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data.
The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained
that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100
population, and that there was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that
the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains

would have been informative. The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was
appropriate. This is because the trial population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent
trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the
primary analysis using SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making. Docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is

appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the uncertainty with not applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking status when
these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line
with the Kaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in mortality in the first 6 months. That is,
the modelling implied a worse survival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone. The Kaplan–Meier
curve showed a slight benefit of docetaxel compared with docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then
transformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in the modelled overall survival curves. The
clinical expert mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus
nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more
people may stop treatment earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a
possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood
vessels that support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in
survival. In addition, the ERG suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this
did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed
with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The committee highlighted the importance of face validity and
concluded that there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling, and that a hazard ratio of 1 between

immaturity of trial data. The company disagreed with equalised relative dose intensity because it considered the trial
data more valid. The clinical expert mentioned that the dose of sotorasib can be modified depending on the level of
unacceptable toxicity, whereas for chemotherapy, the maximum dose is normally applied. The committee © NICE 2024. All

targeted therapies, real-world evidence studies suggest less than 10 months overall survival with second-line treatment
and less than 7 months overall survival with third-line treatment. This was supported with a median overall survival of
7.9 months in SELECT-1 and median overall survival of 10.9 months in LUME-Lung 1. The committee accepted that sotorasib
meets the short life expectancy criterion for end of life. It noted a median overall survival gain from the indirect
treatment comparisons of sotorasib with docetaxel alone (see section 3.5) from the latest March 2021 data-cut, at around

estimated an undiscounted mean overall survival gain for sotorasib compared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib

Drugs Fund referred to an example of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors showing high response rates. They noted that the
disease ca progress and people remain relatively well for some time before having symptoms. The clinical expert agreed
with this. The company highlighte that sotorasib is not a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and that its mechanism o action and
response rate would be different. The ERG disagreed with th company's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued
benefit and highlighted that the evidence is still immature. In its base case, the ERG preferred to apply treatment
effect waning at 2 years and graduall decrease the hazard ratio to 1 over 5 years. This was considered optimistic by the

any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis
including KRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the company's reasoning that overall survival
and progression-free survival are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS
G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from
SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the
MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to
the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC.
It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that
there remains considerable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the
Flatiron study would have been informative. The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the
unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is
also a more recent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial uncertainties with this approach, but
concluded that the primary analysis using SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making. Docetaxel plus
nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate 3.7 In the
secondary indirect treatment comparison of sotorasib versus docetaxel plus nintedanib, the ERG highlighted uncertainties
in the modelling. The company modelled docetaxel and nintedanib in line with NICE's technology appraisal on nintedanib
for previously treated locally © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P ing a advanced,
metastatic, or locally recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. This was because a company-sourced UK advisory board
confirmed that a MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the uncertainty with not applying
adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking status when these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned that the
model's overall survival curve was not in line with the Kaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major

ghlighted the lack of justification for the size of disutility. It also considered the exclusion of any potential
disutility associated with sotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets
once a day compared with docetaxel that is administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company
assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It
acknowledged that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company identified a progression-free survival
utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1, resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free survival base-
case utility. As a result, the company determined that scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025
or 0.04 progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were appropriate to explore. The committee concluded
that it would consider both a disutility and no disutility associated with intravenous administration in its decision-
making. It is appropriate to apply an equalised relative dose intensity sotorasib and its comparators 3.11 The company
applied a relative dose intensity that was lower for sotorasib (89.0%) compared with docetaxel (90.3%) and nintedanib

sotorasib, and any differences may be from random sampling errors. The ERG suggested it was reasonable to apply an
average 90.5% relative dose intensity instead. The ERG preferred this conservative approach because of the impact on
treatment costs and the immaturity of trial data. The company disagreed with equalised relative dose intensity because
it considered the trial data more valid. The clinical expert mentioned that the dose of sotorasib can be modified
depending on the level of unacceptable toxicity, whereas for chemotherapy, the maximum dose is normally applied. The

the estimation of survival was implemented in the model and extrapolated over the time horizon. This showed a mean gain

These covariates were all perfectly matched to SELECT-1 (the exact results are confidential and cannot be © NICE 2024.
All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights small ata se in th y or n th t nt te fo and- he or e 9 of reported

because of missing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain metastases affected prognosis
identified by subgroup analysis. The company mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the trials. The
proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if
the proportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to CodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel
arm and result in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including KRAS mutation status would be
informative. But, it acknowledged the company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival are
similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS G12C-specific population. However, it
explained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that
the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron
Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there
was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for
13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in
this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative.
The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because
the trial population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent trial. The committee recognised
that there are substantial uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis using SELECT-1 for
the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making. Docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi hazard ratio

the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of
£20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective

recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. The committee noted the high level of
uncertainty with an uncontrolled single-arm trial as the primary source of clinical evidence (see section 3.3), the
unanchored indirect treatment comparisons (see section 3.4), and other unresolvable issues. The committee outlined its
preferred modelling assumptions with the current evidence, which should be applied to future cost-effectiveness analyses
for sotorasib with docetaxel monotherapy and docetaxel plus nintedanib: • initial hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6
months for docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling (see section 3.7) • equalised relative dose intensity between treatment
arms (see section 3.11) • consideration of treatment waning effect at 3 and 5 years from the start of treatment (see

positive advanced non-small-cell 3.13 NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most
plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained,
judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will take into account the
degree of certainty around the ICER and whether the technology meets the criteria for consideration as a 'life-extending
treatment at the end of life'. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain
about the ICERs presented. The committee noted the high level of uncertainty with an uncontrolled single-arm trial as
the primary source of clinical evidence (see section 3.3), the unanchored indirect treatment comparisons (see section
3.4), and other unresolvable issues. The committee outlined its preferred modelling assumptions with the current
evidence, which should be applied to future cost-effectiveness analyses for sotorasib with docetaxel monotherapy and
docetaxel plus nintedanib: • initial hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months for docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling
(see section 3.7) • equalised relative dose intensity between treatment arms (see section 3.11) • consideration of
treatment waning effect at 3 and 5 years from the start of treatment (see section 3.8) • consideration of time-to-death
and health-state utilities (see section 3.9) • application and non-application of disutility associated with intravenous
administration (see section 3.10). 3.14 The committee noted the uncertainties informing the cost-effectiveness
estimates, including a single-arm trial as the primary clinical evidence and issues with the unanchored indirect
treatment comparison. After applying confidential discounts for sotorasib and its comparators, and © NICE 2024. All

were higher than what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. The cost-effectiveness results cannot

routine use in the NHS. 3.15 Having concluded that sotorasib could not be recommended for routine use, the committee
then considered if it could be recommended for treating previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive locally agreed by
NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). The company has expressed an
interest in the technology being considered for funding through the mentioned that sotorasib needs to have plausible

1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the Kaplan–Meier curve
in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in mortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a
worse survival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone. The Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight
benefit of docetaxel compared with docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then transformed into a
greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in the modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert
mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first
6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment
earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a possible explanation of the curve
could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth.
Therefore, it can take more time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this did not show a good fit.
Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed with invalidating LUME-
Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded that there are
uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling, and that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is
appropriate. Treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years from the start of treatment are plausible 3.8 The company did not
apply treatment effect waning because it considered the impact of discontinuation on overall and progression-free
survival to be implemented into the hazard function, and therefore, © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice

Because sotorasib is taken until progression or unacceptable toxicity in CodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning
could lead to biased cost-effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was difficult to know how the

noted that the health-state utility approach means that each health state is populated with more people. The committee
noted that for a health- state utility approach, the proportion of people in the progressed state that are closer to

treatment. The committee considered that if a randomised controlled trial was done, the health-related quality of life
in both arms should be the same at the start of treatment. Therefore, this may need to be considered in the approach to
modelling health-related quality of life in the future. The company mentioned that it is open to using health-state

a study comparing © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P a erlotinib with docetaxel in
advanced NSCLC (Lewis et al., 2010). The utilities in that study were derived through a visual analogue scale in the
progression-free health state. The ERG noted that the utilities (0.451 and 0.426 for oral and intravenous therapy,
respectively) in that study were lower than in CodeBreaK100 (0.734). The ERG said it was not opposed to a treatment-
related disutility for intravenous administration but highlighted the lack of justification for the size of disutility.
It also considered the exclusion of any potential disutility associated with sotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue.
This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets once a day compared with docetaxel that is administered intravenously
once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities for a
targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The
company identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1, resulting in a decrement of 0.047

a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04 progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential

agreed that, with longer follow-up data from CodeBreaK100 on mean overall and progression-free survival, and direct
comparative evidence with docetaxel from CodeBreaK200, sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective. Also, that

subgroup analysis. The company mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the trials. The proportion of
people with brain metastases was higher in CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the proportion
of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to CodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result
in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including KRAS mutation status would be informative. But,
it acknowledged the company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival are similar in the absence
of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have
been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary
analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence
data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little difference in the
effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain
metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a
PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative. The committee agreed that using
SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial population was more
comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial
uncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis using SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for
decision-making. Docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months

ing a advanced, metastatic, or locally recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. This was because a company-sourced UK
advisory board confirmed that a MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the uncertainty with not
applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking status when these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned
that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the Kaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely
major increase in mortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a worse survival for docetaxel plus
nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone. The Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight benefit of docetaxel compared with
docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then transformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit for

interest in the technology being considered for funding through the mentioned that sotorasib needs to have plausible
potential to be cost effective. The committee acknowledged that some of the clinical uncertainty may be addressed by
collecting data on sotorasib through CodeBreaK200 trial, comparing sotorasib with docetaxel in a KRAS G12C mutation-
positive population, is currently ongoing. It stated that this trial will measure overall and progression-free survival,
and health-related quality of life. It will also collect data from people with previously treated disease. The committee
agreed that some uncertainty may be resolved with data from the CodeBreak200 trial. The committee recalled its
conclusion that the current cost-effectiveness results were highly uncertain. It agreed that, with longer follow-up data
from CodeBreaK100 on mean overall and progression-free survival, and direct comparative evidence with docetaxel from
CodeBreaK200, sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective. Also, that additional evidence may change the preferred
modelling assumptions outlined in section 3.13. The committee concluded that sotorasib met the criteria to be considered

Sotorasib has a novel mechanism of action in this treatment but all benefits are captured in the modelling 3.17 The
patient and clinical experts emphasised the value of sotorasib as the first targeted treatment option for previously
treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The committee considered the innovative
nature of sotorasib (see section 3.1). It agreed that sotorasib could be considered an important treatment option for
this population. The committee concluded that it did not think there were any additional benefits associated with
sotorasib that had n

d with a median overall survival of 7.9 months in SELECT-1 and median overall survival of 10.9 months in LUME-Lung 1.
The committee accepted that sotorasib meets the short life expectancy criterion for end of life. It noted a median
overall survival gain from the indirect treatment comparisons of sotorasib with docetaxel alone (see section 3.5) from
the latest March 2021 data-cut, at around 15 months of follow up (the exact results are confidential and cannot be
reported here). In addition, the model estimated an undiscounted mean overall survival gain for sotorasib compared with
docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib (the exact results are confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee
agreed that sotorasib was likely to extend life by over 3 months and therefore meets the extension to life criterion.
However, it noted that there were uncertainties with the unanchored indirect treatment comparison methods (see section
3.4). The committee concluded that sotorasib may meet both end of life criteria, but the length of life extension is
uncertain. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P Sotorasib for previously treated KRAS G12C

most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained,
judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will take into account the
degree of certainty around the ICER and whether the technology meets the criteria for consideration as a 'life-extending
treatment at the end of life'. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain
about the ICERs presented. The committee noted the high level of uncertainty with an uncontrolled single-arm trial as
the primary source of clinical evidence (see section 3.3), the unanchored indirect treatment comparisons (see section
3.4), and other unresolvable issues. The committee outlined its preferred modelling assumptions with the current
evidence, which should be applied to future cost-effectiveness analyses for sotorasib with docetaxel monotherapy and
docetaxel plus nintedanib: • initial hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months for docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling
(see section 3.7) • equalised relative dose intensity between treatment arms (see section 3.11) • consideration of
treatment waning effect at 3 and 5 years from the start of treatment (see section 3.8) • consideration of time-to-death
and health-state utilities (see section 3.9) • application and non-application of disutility associated with intravenous
administration (see section 3.10). 3.14 The committee noted the uncertainties informing the cost-effectiveness
