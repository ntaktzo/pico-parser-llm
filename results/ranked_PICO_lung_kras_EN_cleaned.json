earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company
suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is
anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that
support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an
effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG
suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and
26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG
preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company
disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lu

2. (Effect, score 7) The company
disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The
committee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded
that there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling,
and that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate. Treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years from the start of
treatment are plausible

survival base-case utility. As a result, the company determined that
scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04

appropriate to explore. The committee concluded that it would consider
