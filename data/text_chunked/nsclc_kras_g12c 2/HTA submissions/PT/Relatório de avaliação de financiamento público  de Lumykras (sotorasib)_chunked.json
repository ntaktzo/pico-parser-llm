Globally, only 18% of new cases are still alive at 5 years of age or older. A number of cases are diagnosed at the latest (in the UK), because the number of cases of male and female cancer is estimated to be much lower than the national estimate. The data on lung cancer are fractional, having been mainly studied in North America. A activation of viral mutations in rats with Kirsten sarcoma (KRAS) is found in 25 to 30% of non-escamous CPNPCs, representing the target but not prevalent CPNPC. The CPNPC KRAS mutated constitute a molecularly diversified and clinically heterogeneous group.",

In terms of comparative fiction, the data from the interim analysis of the clinical trial of phase III indicate that the treatment with advanced CPNPC resulted in an improvement in survival of 1.1 months and a 34% reduction in the probability of progression or benefit from treatment that was demonstrated in comparison with a further treatment of patients with a different prognosis (HRAS 0.66% [95, 0.86], GHRAS 0.55 - 0.86, GHRAS 0.002), evaluation of the progress of patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, including patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, and the analysis of patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, including patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, who have not developed a further treatment of 0.6 months, and who have not received 0.89, 0.89, and who have not received 0.89, respectively, from the evaluation of the clinical trial of patients with a further treatment of patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, 9.99, 0.9%, have demonstrated that the clinical evaluation of the clinical trial of 0.99, 0.9%, and the clinical trial of 0.99, and the clinical trial of 0.99, respectively, and the clinical trial of 0.89, respectively, and the clinical trial of the This conclusion is based on the following facts: • The data from the interim analysis of the clinical trial of phase III CodeBreaK 200 did not show any difference in overall survival between treatment groups, having observed a difference in survival book of progress of 1.1 months relative to alternative comparator docetaxel (HR 0.66 [95%CI: 0.51, 0.86], value -p=0.002), with improvement in evaluation of progress compared to the 12 months (24.8%).",

Conclusions The medicinal product Lumykras (Sotorasib) was subject to a prior evaluation for the purposes of public financing for the treatment of patients with lung cancer of non-small cells (CPNPC) advanced with KRAS G12C mutado and that have progressed after, at least, a line of systemic therapy. Compared to docetaxel, the medicinal product below no demonstrated therapeutic value added, because it was not financed by this indication. This conclusion is based on the following facts: - data from the evaluation of the clinical trial phase III CodeBreaK 200 no evidence of any difference in the safety of treatment groups, which have at least a prior evaluation, [92] - 13.5% of the overall progress of the treatment compared with the data from the clinical trial phase II, which showed a survival rate of 0.1%, and which showed a survival rate of 21.5% of the patient in the last few months: - 0.8%, - 9.8%, - 9.8%, - 8.8%, - 8.8%, - 8.8%, - 0.1%, - 0.1%, - 0.0%, - 0.0%, - 0.0%, - 0.8%, - 0.0%, - 0.0%,",
