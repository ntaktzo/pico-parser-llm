However, according to the results of the indirect comparison, patients treated with sotorasib have a reduced risk of disease progression and death compared to the best supportive care. In the health economic analysis of the current patient population, TLV is assumed to have better efficacy than the best supportive treatment. However, the extent of efficacy of treatment with sotorasib is uncertain. The results are associated with very high uncertainties as the analysis is based on an indirect comparison of several uncertain parameters. The costs of Lumyras are considered to be reasonable in relation to the benefit of usually patients with the best supportive treatment. In a sensitivity analysis, the median OS in the Lumytra arm shortens by one month and also shortens survival in the best supportive arm to a small extent. The median OS is reduced by one month on the basis that patients with ECOG PS 1 or ECOG PS 1 had two months shorter overall survival than those with ECOG PS 0 in the CodeBreaK 200. The company believes that those who were not up to date for docetaxel could have ECOG PS 0 or ECOG PS 1 at approximately as high a level, which is the reason for the assumption of one month shorter median OS than the ITT population in CodeBreaK 200. The shortening of total survival (1 month) is based on data from CodeBreaK 200 where patients were not eligible for docetaxel.",
