      "text": "The benefit-risk ratio of the clinical trial is assessed by the clinical trial of the clinical trial. In a scenario analysis, the company uses data from CodeBreaK 200, where the overall survival of docetaxel is modelled with a constant hazard ratio, which means that the probability of survivors at a certain time point to die is always lower for those who have been treated with Lumykras and that the reduced probability is equal throughout the time horizon. In a scenario analysis, the TLV estimates that there is no need to start from a constant treatment effect against docetaxel. The OS curves do not exhibit the constant treatment effect during the follow-up period. Up to and with month 5, the lower risk of death in the Lumykras arm is then used by the company as a scenario analysis. In terms of overall survival, TLV estimates that there is no need to start from a constant treatment effect against docetaxel. On the basis of the above-mentioned clinical benefit of the clinical trial, the benefit of the clinical trial and the benefit of the clinical trial. However, overall survival and progression-free survival may be lower in both treatment arms and adjusted in the health economic analysis. However, according to the results of the indirect comparison, patients treated with sotorasib have a reduced risk of disease progression and death compared to the best supportive care. In the health economic analysis of the current patient population, TLV is assumed to have better efficacy than the best supportive treatment. However, the extent of efficacy of treatment with sotorasib is uncertain. The results are associated with very high uncertainties as the analysis is based on an indirect comparison of several uncertain parameters. The costs of Lumyras are considered to be reasonable in relation to the benefit of usually patients with the best supportive treatment. In a sensitivity analysis, the median OS in the Lumytra arm shortens by one month and also shortens survival in the best supportive arm to a small extent. The median OS is reduced by one month on the basis that patients with ECOG PS 1 or ECOG PS 1 had two months shorter overall survival than those with ECOG PS 0 in the CodeBreaK 200. The company believes that those who were not relevant to docetaxel would be able to have ECOG PS 0 or ECOG PS 1 at approximately as high a level, which is the reason for the assumption of one month shorter median OS than the ITT population in CodeBreaK 200. The shortening of total survival (1 month) is based on data from CodeBreaK 200 where patients could not be disabled for docetaxel, and therefore, for patients with ECOG PS 1 not more than month, the rate of reduction in the median OS than the ITT population in the CodeBreaK 200 is not adequate. The reason for this is that patients in poor condition are treated with Lumykras for a shorter period of time and that even those who receive the best supportive treatment can have a shorter survival rate when they are in poor condition.",
