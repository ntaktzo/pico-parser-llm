It should be noted that there is no higher quality evidence for the treatment of NSCLC related to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. So far, there are no other approved medicinal treatments besides sotorasib that are explicitly used in the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation according to the marketing authorisation. According to the scientific-medical societies involved and the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), the treatment standards correspond to those of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer without specifically treatable oncogenic driver mutations. For the present therapeutic indication, it is also assumed that the patients are generally eligible for active antineoplastic therapy, which is why best supportive care is not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy in the present case. In the second-line treatment, depending on the first-line therapy, a distinction is made between a) patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody monotherapy pretreatment, b) patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment and c) after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and a platinum-containing chemotherapy as pretreatment. In the present procedure, patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment (patient group b) and patients after first-line therapy with an anti-PD- 1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy (patient group c) are relevant. b) Following first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy For patients with NSCLC for whom further antineoplastic therapy is indicated after first- line chemotherapy, several treatment options are available on the basis of the available evidence with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents docetaxel and pemetrexed, in each case as monotherapy, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib and the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, partly only under certain conditions. With docetaxel and pemetrexed, both as monotherapy, two established chemotherapeutic agents are available for second-line chemotherapy, although pemetrexed is unsuitable for predominantly squamous histology. For the combination of docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June 2015). In the guidelines, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib is recommended alongside the other chemotherapy options, but is not regularly preferred over them. Based on the available evidence and corresponding therapy recommendations in the guidelines, docetaxel and pemetrexed, each as monotherapy, as well as docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, are considered therapeutically comparable, subject to tumour histology and the different side effect profile. For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 4 February 2016). For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and non-squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was also identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). For pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, used after prior chemotherapy, the benefit assessment also found an indication of a major additional benefit compared to docetaxel (pembrolizumab: resolution of 2 February 2017, atezolizumab: resolution of 16 March 2018).",

Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016). Likewise, no additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment of afatinib compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). Taking into account that benefit-assessed medicinal treatments with an additional benefit are available in the present indication, the treatment options ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel as well as afatinib, for which no additional benefit could be determined in each case, are not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy. In the overall assessment, the G-BA determined docetaxel, pemetrexed, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as equally appropriate comparator therapies for this patient group. The additional benefit can be demonstrated compared to one of the treatment options mentioned.",

Prior therapy should include combined or sequential platinum-containing combination chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1.

For enrolment in the study, patients should have a general condition according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) ≤ 1, no relevant limitations in renal and liver function and no haematological limitations. The total of 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with sotorasib (N = 171) or docetaxel (N = 174), stratified by number of prior lines of therapy in advanced stage of the disease (1 vs 2 vs > 2), descent (Asian vs non-Asian) and brain metastases at the time of randomisation (yes vs no).

Health status In the CodeBreak 200 study, health status was assessed both with the PGI-C questionnaire (change in physical condition via the symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath) and via the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS). With regard to the evaluations of the VAS of the EQ-5D, a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel is shown for the endpoint of health status. Symptomatology As a result of the above assessment of the data, the present assessment assumes an overall positive effect of sotorasib on symptomatology compared to docetaxel. This assessment is supported by the consistent and, in some cases, very significant effects on several endpoints on symptomatology as well as the statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib in the endpoint of health status (EQ-5D VAS). Notwithstanding the fact that the differential percentage of > 15 percentage points per se results in a high risk of bias and a resulting large uncertainty, an overall advantage can thus be derived for sotorasib with regard to symptomatology. Conclusion on morbidity endpoints: In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified. Health-related quality of life The health-related quality of life of the patients in the CodeBreak 200 study is assessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. As a result of the above assessment of the data, the large uncertainty predominates based on a weighing of the extent of the differential percentage of patients included in the treatment arms in the evaluation and the magnitude of the effects on the quality of life endpoints.",
