The pronostic or predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation is currently poorly defined in the CBNPC, and there is no (before the provision of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib)) specific treatment targeting this mutation. The current therapeutic management of the CBNPC is identical whether or not patients have a KRAS mutation (including G12C). At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended to propose a systematic second-line treatment, whether or not patients have responded to a 1st metastatic line.

It should be stressed that, in this context, where no comparable data of acceptable methodological quality is available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of treatment with LUMYKRAS (sotorasib), the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapeutic strategy is accompanied by a greater risk-taking than for medicinal products whose efficacy is based on a comparison with an appropriate methodology.",

Summary & Discussion The request for inclusion of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the monotherapy indication in the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC, with the KRAS G12C mutation, whose disease progressed after at least one previous systemic treatment line, is based primarily on a non-comparative Phase 2 \"basket\" study (CodeBreak 100) and indirect comparison data. CodeBreak 100 is a \"basket\" study that included adult patients with advanced solid tumours with the KRAS G12C mutation. The primary judgement criterion for the cohort of patients with an NSCLC was the objective response rate, evaluated by an independent review committee, according to the RECIST criteria. 1.1 Only data from the CBNPC cohort were used for this assessment. Efficacy (of which quality of life) A total of 126 patients received patients with a prior cohort was considered to have been identified as having had been identified as having had been identified as having had had had been not been not been identified. The median duration of response was approximately 8.4 months (IC95%: 6.9-8.4), progression-free survival of 6.7 months (IC95%: 4.9-8.1) and overall survival of 12.0 months (9.5-NE). The follow-up exploratory data suggested similar results.",
