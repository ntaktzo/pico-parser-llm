The most common are 4 types of histology: • glandular cancer (45% - increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancer (DRP) differs from other histological and clinical conditions (high rate of proliferation, short time of tumour doubling; • exceptional tendency to early metastases, chemotherapy and relative sensitivity).",
