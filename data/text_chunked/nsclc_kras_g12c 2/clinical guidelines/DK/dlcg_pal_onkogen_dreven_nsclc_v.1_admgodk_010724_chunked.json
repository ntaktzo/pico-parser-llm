The understanding of the molecular biology mechanisms is in rapid development following the introduction of next generation sequence (NGS).

Our classic assessment of efficacy on the basis of large randomised phase III studies will be developed. Patients with oncogen-driven NSCLC have generally a better prognosis than the other patients with NSCLC. However, the patient group often has less comorbidity and no or sparring history of back (not applicable to the KRAS G12C variant) compared to the other group of patients with the NSCLC. Oncogen-driven NSCLC can occur in smokers and therefore all patients with adenocarcinomas or NSCLCNOS should be cleared with a broad genomic profile, independent of smoking history. Furthermore, genomic prognosis of tumours from patients with squamous carcinoma at young age or patients with squamous cell carcinoma should be considered in the clinical group of patients with no longer than patients with placebo.",

Monotherapy immunotherapy is generally not recommended, see recommendation 11. Patient values and preferences There is not expected much variation in patients' preferences as the recommended medicinal products have a better effect and less adverse effects than chemotherapy. Rationale Recommendations's wording: \"should' is used when the recommendation reflects MR treatment guidelines. \"Consider: Use when the recommendation does not reflect MR treatment guidelines but reflects the EMA guidelines. Comments and considerations Parts of the guideline recommendations can only be obtained by prior approval in the region's medical committees. In the DoLG, there is a difference in the assessments of the medical committees across the regions. Furthermore, there is a difference between the resources of each department to carry out an application process. The following guide (see Annex 2) and the guideline itself, in its form, is an attempt to facilitate the work of the individual treating physician/ department in the application process and thus ensure one's treatment of patients across the regions.",

The management group of the clinical quality database has the mandate to decide on the database's indicator sets, including which specific processes and results are monitored in the database. Parts of the guideline recommend treatments that have not yet been assessed in MRI. It is therefore suggested that indicators be established that allow 1) monitoring of the regions' permissions for the treatment of recommendations and 2) the effectiveness of the treatments (e.g. ORR, PFS and DOR).",
