However, the incidence of the incidence among women in Austria is still declining in the two years. Socioeconomic status Lung cancer risk is not only inversely correlated with socio-economic status [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The incidence of lung cancer is higher in low-income population groups, low occupational status and low educational level [5]. To a large extent, the higher prevalence of smoking in people with low socio-economic status contributes to their higher lung cancer risk. In addition, however, there is often also an unfavourable constellation of interacting determinants such as diet and exposure to carcinogenics in the environment [9] or at work, the influence of which is difficult to quantify [10]. At regional level in Germany, the incidence of lung cancer is only increased in men in areas with low socio-economic status [4]. In women, with small-scale data, no significant relationship between regional socioeconomic status and lung cancer can be established.",

In the case of patients who have been diagnosed with the disease after one year of therapy, however, the results show that stopping therapy after one year increases the risk of a progression.

The selectivity of tumor tissue is based on a lack of competitive inhibition of an end product, an active metabolic power or a decreased clearance of the sensitizer from cancer cells. When irradiation is carried out with red light from a laser source, cytotoxic products are produced that lead to direct tumour decay or to tumor infarction by closing its vessels. There are many publications with small numbers of cases, especially from Japan. The design of the studies is mostly of limited quality. Many reviews and meta-analysis with data from more than 1200 patients emphasize the importance of the method [1484], [1477] (Evidenz grade 2c). There are still technical problems to illuminate the tumor region completely and evenly necessary. If an invasive tumor exceeds the wall, due to light loss, the tumor destruction cannot be achieved.

Thus, in the first three to four years, there were no differences in survival data from the structured imaging follow-up studies. However, after four to five years, a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours was shown. These can then be partially treated again. The long-term survival results of this study are still pending, but overall, the DFS lead for the intensive post-mortem group is a semi-mortem assessment of the outcome of the study. Also for the screening of brain metastases in post-care and the importance of outcomes, there are currently no clinical data available for the diagnosis of brain metastases, so that screening for brain metastases in clinically inconspicuous patients is not recommended without clear risk indication. However, this point is to be answered in risk situations with LD-SCLC, with ED-SCLC and especially with the question of using PCI or alternatively imaging observation with PCI or stereotaxia of metastases.",
