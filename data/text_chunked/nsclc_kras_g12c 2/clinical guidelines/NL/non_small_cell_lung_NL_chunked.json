      "text": "Pathogenesis Different factors contribute to the emergence of lung carcinoma. These are smoking [Molina 2008(7)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) [Collins 2007(6)], asbestos exposure, air pollution such as fine dust (fin particles) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 (PM) or even 2,5 micrometers, and genetic factors [Molina 2008(7), Pleasance 2010(8)]. Smoking is the main factor, especially for small cell lung cancer and plavice cell carcinoma. Resection rates and postoperative mortality in 7899 patients with lung cancer. Eur Respir J 9:97- Baseline question What is the value of screening to lung cancer? Recommendation Long carcinoma screening is advised in high-risk groups, by centres that have a low-dose CT and specific software. In addition, there must be knowledge and competence for screening. Smoking cessation is an integral part of screening. Considerations There are strong indications that with better definition of the risk profile of a nodus additional diagnostics can be limited. Also, there are indications from the NELSON-trial that there is less follow-up diagnostics required than in the NLST-trial. That means that the cost effectiveness will be improved and the radiation load will decrease. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening with a low-dose CT for age category 55 - 80 years with 30 pack years of smokers and have been stopped or in the past 15 years. Screening should be stopped if there is no longer a health risk. NLST 2011(3) Summary of literature Although some scientific associations recommend lung cancer screening in high-risk groups (especially smokers and ex-smokers who stopped smoking ≤10 years ago), there are still uncertainties about the value of these recommendations for clinical practice. The recommendation is based in particular on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with 53.454 participants, who showed a decrease in lung cancer specific mortality by 20% by applying low-dose CT with a well-trained staff [NSLT 2011(3), 2013(4)]. The total mortality decreased by 6.7%.",

References Initial question What is the position of the FDG-PET in the diagnostics of the mediastinal? Recommendation Patients with NSCLC who are eligible for a deliberate curative treatment, should be the first choice to undergo a combined FDG-PET/diagnostic CT. A diagnostic CT and a separate FDG-PET is second choice. If an FDG-PET-CT has been performed, there is no indication of a skeletalcintigraphy and ultrasound of the upper abdomen. Considerations A French cost-effectiveness study showed that the FDG-PET with a CT for the anatomical locating of asymptomatic lymph nodes is a cost-effective alternative compared to a CT only (32) The life expectancy has increased by 0.1 years, while the expected cost reduction of € 61. An American study finds lower costs associated with a selective use of FDG-PET in patients with normal analysis and TCT-type. Since in patients with a NSCLC there is often an indication for both CT and FDG-PET, it is efficient to combine an FDG-PET in one session with a CT with diagnostic quality. Whether this is feasible depends on local conditions, such as the logistics surrounding access to the FDG-PET-CT, the access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the FDG-PET-CT device, the possibility of contrast administration and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear medical assessment. Preferably, the FDG-PET with a diagnostic CT should result in an integrated nuclear-medical radiological report. As image formation precedes the invasive diagnostics, a good organization with short access times is important. For planned curative surgery, at least a FDG-PET (with low-dose CT) should be performed. The radiation load of an FDG-PET is about 19 microSievert/Megabecquerel.Because of increasing sensitivity of the detectors, the administered amount of FDG has been reduced to approx. 200-400 MBq in recent years and the radiation load at this dose is 4-7 mSv. Anno 2010 has been replaced almost all FDG-PET devices by combined PET-CT devices, with both PET and CT being carried out in one session. In this case, a so-called low-dose CT is generally produced (ray load approx. 1-3 mSv) which is used for the required weakening correction of the FDG-PET images and for determining the anatomical localizations with increased metabolic activity. Then, in the same session, a CT of diagnostic quality can be made using intravenous X-ray contrast. The FDG-PET is only usable for urbanization as the primary tumor FDG. Many of the articles on which the above-mentioned reviews were based were still carried out with FDG-PET alone and not with combined FDG-PET-CT. A qualitatively good primary diagnostic accuracy study with FDG-PET-CT compared the performance of the FDG-PET component with CT only (18). A total sensitivity for mediastinal metastases of 92% was measured with a specificity of 84%, at the level of individual mediastinal lymph nodes. For CT alone, 74% and 59% were found. For the distinction between N0 or N1 versus N2 disease, the sensitivity of FDG-PET-CT is 72%, specificity 89%. For CT alone, this is 52% and 73%. As a golden standard, 80% of the patients with FDG-PET-CT is correctly settled (CT 56%). Two of these randomized studies showed that the FDG-PET-CT reduces the number of redundant thoracotomys (19) (20), just like a study reported in the FDG-PET era (21). In an Australian study, this difference is not found (22).",

      "text": "It is important to realize that the CT made in the framework of FDG-PET-CT (and on which the above mentioned sensitivities and specificitys are based) is a so-called low dose CT and is intended for actuation and scatter correction and for anatomical relationships. The diagnostic quality of the FDG-PET-CT further improves if the data of the diagnostic contrast CT are combined with the FDG-PET data. As is known, the FDG-PET can give error-negative outcomes in small dimensions of metastases (< 6-8 mm) or with small metastatic foci in larger lymph nodes. Fout-positive outcomes occur in inflammation or infection in glands (sarcoidose, tuberculosis). From the data available on the CT, if there is no enlarged mediastinal gland and the FDG-PET is positive (metabole activity shows), 56% of the lymph nodes show a metastasis, and if FDG-PET is negative there is only 3% metastasis. If the CT shows enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and the FDG-PET is positive too, then the probability of a metastasis is 75%. If the FDG-PET is negative in enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on the CT then the sensitivity of the FDG-PET is higher when all glands are considered to be 100%. However, the specificity of the FDG-PET is lower (78%), since infectious glands are more likely to increase. This leads to a negative predictive value of all the The accuracy of the FDG-PET to show adrenal metastases approaches the 100% but this concerns deviations > 15 mm (5). The combined sensitivity/specificity for all intra-abdominal (liver, adrenal) metastases was 85%/56%, respectively, where the CT with contrast was often used as a reference test. Although false positivity is rare, a biopsy is performed for confirmation.",

This exceeds the diagnostic performance of a skeletal scintigraphy. Also in Dutch research, the combination of the Desire criteria with FDG-PET led to the highest diagnostic value (28).

Recommendation FDG-PET and MRI of the brain should be performed in patients with an NSCLC in clinical stage III.

In a Canadian-randomized study, in patients without any clinical indication for extrathoracic metastases, an algorithm with CT-thorax followed by mediastinaloscopy is often more redundant than when skeletal scintigraphy, CT of brain, liver and adrenals are added (6). More extrathoracic metastases have been found in the intensively screened group (7% versus 3%; p=0.04), but no significant difference in ostensibly open-poet operations, incomplete resections and relapses after resection (relative risk extended versus limited stadification: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.56-1.13; p=0.20).It is obvious that the yield of screening to distance metastases depends on how one defines the clinical indications for metastass (7).",

In patients over 80 years of age without major comorbidity and in good condition, a resection as a treatment modality should be considered, if doctor and patient consider the surgical risk acceptable. Cardiovascular risk factors Preoperative should be detected by means of anamnesis, physical examination and ECG heart diseases such as coronary disease, heart failure, valve disease and arrhythmias. In the case of intended lung surgery and (suspecting) a heart disease, a cardiologist, an intensive care medical or an anesthesiologist should make an estimate of the perioperative risk and advise on the perioperative policy. Long function study If the forced-expiration volume is not met in one second (FEV) and the diffusion capacity (TLCO) are both > 80% and there is no unexpected dyspnoea d'effort, the surgery risk is not considered to be increased. In case of reduced lung function (FEV and/or TLCO < 80% of predicted) the predicted postoperative lung function (FEV ppo and TLCO ppo) should be calculated using the calculation method (quantitative perfusion scan combined with segments method). If in doubt, if the exercise tolerance appears much better or much worse than is expected from lung function research, or in other situations where an increased risk is suspected, it is recommended to do an effort test with determination of the VO max. The theoretical background of this recommendation is that the VOmax is the most physiological value that can expose the weakest link in heart, lungs, vessels or muscles. (23) An exercise test with determination of the VO max can be based on the following indications: VO max > 20 ml/min/kg: no increased risk; VO max > 15 ml/min/kg: no increased risk for lobectomy or smaller resections; with VO max and perfusion scan: predicted postoperative VO max < 10 ml/min/kg: significantly increased operating risk.

Risk of perioperative morbidity is in general no reason to refrain from lung surgery and is not involved for this reason. The literature appears to contain only sporadic studies in which the quality of life after lung surgery is an outcome, which makes a conclusion impossible.A. Age Patients over 70 years of age have an increased risk of surgery for lung surgery: in more than 1,500 lung operations in the region of IKNL location Rotterdam a perioperative mortality rate of 4% was found in this age group: 8% in pneumonectomies and 3% in smaller resections (1). In other studies, a slightly higher mortality rate is often found (2) (3). Recent Dutch studies show a 30-day surgical mortality rate of 7.5% in patients over 75 years of age (5). This increased risk is probably due to a higher mortality rate in patients over 80 years of age.",

If the growth is central to the fisssure, it is often a pneumonectomy the treatment of choice. According to the working group, the percentage of resections carried out by surgeons is strongly. For the decision during the procedure, this is of little importance, because in most cases there is no technical problem and these structures can easily be involved in the resection. 5. T4 tumors For all T4 tumors, it is important to consider large interventions in which the expertise and experience of the operator play an important role and the concept of irresectable is determined by the skill of the surgeon. Often, preoperatively, it is possible to estimate the degree of difficulty. This form of lung surgery should take place in a center. In open thorax, it often requires a lot of preparation work in large and/or nearby tumors before a complete resection can be properly assessed. It is incorrect to qualify a tumor based on volatile inspection as an irresectable. In patients with a T1N0- or T2N0-NSCLC, a lobectomy offers the best prognosis and therefore the lowest probability of local recurrence is in those cases. (15) The postoperative morbidity and mortality of a thorax sleeve resection is less than a pneumonectomy, while the 5-year survival is similar. In any central-growing tumor, therefore, it is necessary to examine whether a resection with reconstruction of the artera pulmonalis does not lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Data on long-term results and on a comparison with pneumonectomy are missing. Level 3: C Vogt-Moykopf 1983, (32) Read 1993, (33) Rendina 1999.

Others had previously made similar findings in studies comparing the results of a lobectomy to a wig or segment resection, (1) (2) (3) (4) (6). Landreneau et al. published in 1997 a study comparing 102 patients with a T1N0-NSCLC undergoing a wigresection with 117 similar patients undergoing a lobectomy (7). The 5-year survival of patients with an open wigresection was 58%, of patients with a VATS wedge section 65% and of patients undergoing a lobectomy 70%. Their results therefore confirmed the outcome of the study of the Lung Cancer Study Group (LCSG). In Japan, the 1990s, a number of studies were carried out in which tumours < 2 cm were still treated with a segment resection (8) (9) (10). In this study, high 5-year survival rates were found: 82% and 89%. The 5-year survival of T1-T2-tumors after a segment or wigresection in patients with compromised lung function ranges from 42 to 69% (2) (12) (13). There are no comparative studies comparing this patient population with deliberate curative radiotherapy. Tumor growth to another lobe, bronchusostium or arteria pulmonalis If tumor tissue grows from one lobe in another or there is growth of tumor tissue at the ostium of the bronchus or ingrowth in the a. pulmonalis, a (bi)lobectomy may not be sufficient. However, a pneumonectomy will be considered. A pneumonectomy has a much higher morbidity and mortality than a lobectomy. In a survey conducted in 1983, in which the Lung Cancer Study Group 2200 resections were investigated, the mortality after a pneumonectomy was 6.2% and after a lobectomy 2.9% (14). In a recent study with 485 patients a similar percentages were found. Sleeve'-resections are a little more likely to give a local recurrence than a pneumonectomy, but the long-term results are better. In addition, the quality of life is better and its resections are also more cost-effective. Series show that 5-8% of the total number of interventions is eligible for a enoatesleeve'-lobectomy (31). If growth in the pulmonalis artery doesn't allow a simple lobectomy, then the first large series of interventions with 37 angioplastic interventions (32) They reported a high postoperative mortality rate of 17% at a feline double sleeve. Later, good results were reported in small series (33).",

The lymph nodes of station 12 (lobary) are not included in the lung block' with the lobectomy preparation. The lymph nodes of stations 11 (interlobary) and 10 (hilair) are usually separated. During pneumonectomy, the intrapulmonal and hilary lymph nodes are not removed block' with the resection preparation of these lymph nodes. Intraoperative inspection and palpation are not reliable methods for the detection of lymph node metastases. This was demonstrated, among other things, by a study of 95 patients undergoing a pulmonary resection due to NSCLC, comparing the intraoperative visual and palpatory findings of 287 mediastinal lymph nodes with the enzymatic findings. Sensitivity of inspection and palpation was 71% and specificity 94%. In 9 of 95 patients, the assessment of lymph node stations was error negative (39). In a retrospective comparative study was diagnosed with systematic mediastinal lymph node-sampling' and complete mediastinal lymph node dissection 2.7 times as much (95%-BI: 1.2-6,3) N2 disease was not present in the N1 glands (assuming) on the basis of abnormal intraoperative findings (40). The absence of lymph nodemetastases in N1 stations does not imply that evaluation of the asymptomatic lymph node glands is superfluous. A positive lavage is found more frequently at a higher TNM stage and is related to a worse prognosis (46) (47) (52) (48) (49) (50). Multivariate analysis in one of these studies showed that a positive cytology result of the pleural lavage is an independent determinant of the prognosis (50). However, survival is better than in patients with pleural effusion based on pleuritis carcinomatosa (50). In the study of Hillerdal et al., a difference in 3-year survival was found, which was not statistically significant: 64% in negative cytology results versus 41% in positive (53). It is conceivable that the statistical lavage of this study was insufficient to show a significant difference.",

The current studies all use a form of platinum-doublet chemotherapy as control-arm treatment for NSCLC patients at all stages, from IB to IIIC. This is not necessarily consistent with standard practice, in which patients in the previous stages are first operated. For the advanced stages, from IIIA to IIIB, there is no consensus on the best control-arm-treatment. In neoadjuvant chemoimmune therapy there is a real risk that patients do not undergo the scheduled surgery due to side effects of the treatment. Also, testing on PD-L1 was of great importance for the operation.The current studies in the subgroup analyses showed that patients with PD-L1 negative tumours have very little benefit from adding immune therapy.Subgroup analyses also showed that patients with lower stages of NSCLC, such as stage I, benefit less from the treatment strategies discussed.It was also shown that both the OS and EFS benefit for the entire study population was mainly driven by the PD-L1 positive subgroups.In line with these reasons, the EMA has demonstrated the use of neoadjuvant chemo-nivolumab (Checkmate-816) only for patients with a PD-L1 positive NSCLC in stage II-III.In the context of adjuvant immune therapies, the IMpower010 study showed that the advantage of adjuvant atezolizumab was higher in patients in stage II-IIIA with positive PD-L1-expression compared to patients who were not selected on the basis of PD-L1 expression. For this specific group of patients, chemotherapy should be considered or reference should be made to clinical studies aimed at targeted new treatment methods.",

In the PACIFIC study, patients with each PD-L1 expression as well as with an unknown PD-L1 status were included. No clinically relevant differences in adverse reactions between durvalumab and placebo were found. The START study found no clinically relevant difference in the median survival between tecemotide and control (i.e. median survival 25.8 and 22.4 months), with a HR for death of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.03). However, the START study was interrupted early due to the occurrence of encephalitis by tecemotide in any other study in patients with multiple myeloma. The adverse reactions of tecemotide were similar to those of placebo, these were due to premature discontinuation of the study due to adverse events in any other indication area not to be reliably interpreted. In neither study data were published until now quality of life data.",

      "text": "Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) The treatment with adjuvanted immunotherapy can take place in centres that meet the criteria for palliative immunotherapy, thus achieving optimal results for survival, side effects and quality of life. Costs (prevention) Healthcare Institute Netherlands investigated in 2019 the costs and cost-effectiveness of durvalumab after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy at stage III NSCLC. The average cost per patient is €145.932 for durvalumab and €72.393 for active follow-up. The average incremental cost per patient is €73.539 compared to the cost of active follow-up. Quality of life The effects of the treatments are expressed in terms of quality of life corrected life years (QALY) and gained years of life (LYG). Durvalumab results in 5.05 QALY per patient and 2.99 QALY when active follow the overall average health gain is therefore 2-06 QALY per patient compared to active follow. By using durvalumab, the average number of LYG 6.12 and active follow-effect (LYG) is 3.65. Radiotherapy often causes multiple changes in the lungs and in the tumor and/or irradiated glands that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, abnormalities in the thorax to the contrary are proven to be similar as post-radiotherapy findings. Additional studies are only rarely necessary. The CT scan of thorax and upper abdomen is performed with intravenous contrast, unless there are contra-indications. This CT scan is an additional study that needs to be performed and where sufficient capacity should be provided in the radiology department. Preclinical studies found that PD-1 inhibition together with radiotherapy works best if both are given together or if the PD-(L) 1 inhibitor is given as soon as possible after the end of radiotherapy. For the suggestion in the PACIFIC-trial that patients who receiveddurvalumab within 2 weeks after the end of the irradiation were given a better survival than if thedurvalumab was administered later has no evidence, but does have a biological rational treatment during and after the competitor chemotherapy and radiotherapy should also be optimally Recommendation-2 Rationale/ balance between arguments for and against intervention Due to lack of studies with high probative strength and premature discontinuation of a study, due to adverse reactions in another indication area, the working group considers that it is still too early to recommend tecemotide after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Supporting Background The prognosis of patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has remained unchanged for the last decade.",

In the IMpower150 study (Socinski, 2018), in the group with negative PD-L1 expressed on both tumour cells and immune cells, a statistically significant advantage was seen for the group treated with the atezolizumab combination versus the group treated with the placebo combination. However, the hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), which did not meet the criteria defined by the group for a clinically relevant difference in the group with respect to the treatment of the atezolizumab combination. This included both an overestimate and an underestimate of the actual degree of PD-L1 expression. A part of the patients in the subgroup with a PD-L1 negative tumour in the biopsies will in reality have a tumour with some degree of PD-L1 expression. Thus, they are more likely to benefit from the treatment of the combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy than predicative markers thought. Another argument is that of all patients receiving first-line chemotherapy more than half of them does not belong to a form of tumor-oriented second-line treatment and therefore not to the potential benefits of immunotherapy (Davies, 2017; Lazzari, 2017). Nevertheless, the evidence for adding immunotherapy to treatment in this patient category is limited and treatment with chemotherapy is certainly also a good possibility to be discussed with patient. For the squaveiselcellig NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS <1% there was at the time of the literature search for this guideline no evidence of adding to the treatment in this category of immunotherapy. For treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a non-curable NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS ≥50% the probative moderate is not known. The same applies to patients with a non-claveel cell NSCLC independent of PD-L1 expression. For all other treatment combinations described, the GRADE scores for evidence are low to very low. In the group of patients with a PD-L1 TPS ≥50% is not a good ruling on which treatment leads to the best outcome. There is no direct comparison of monotherapy pembrolizumab with either immunotherapy chemotherapy combinations and these combinations are also not directly compared to each other. On the basis of toxicity profile and financial impact, the working group prefers treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy. In specific cases and in consultation with the patient it can be deviated from one of the combinations with immunotherapy chemotherapy. An ECOG performance score ≥2, important and active autoimmune disease, chronic use of immunosuppression with a dose equivalent of >10mg prednisone/day and untreated or symptomatic brain metastases were considered as an exclusion criterion for the included trials. To date, no randomised data on these patient groups is available. About the treatment of patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 or higher with immunotherapy as a first-line treatment in NSCLC is little data for hands. An ECOG performance score of 2 or higher was an exclusion criterion in all studies with immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy for this line of treatment. Partly preliminary data from studies in the second-line setting, among others the checkmate 153 and checkmate 171 studies (Popat, 2017; Spigel, 2017), show no significant survival benefit for immunotherapy in this subgroup of patients. In these patients there is also no place for first-line treatment with immunotherapy or immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination.",

In this respect, pharmacological exposure at a fixed dose does not appear to be less than at a dose based on body weight and may lead to a cost reduction, inter alia by reducing the waste of medication (Hendrikx, 2017; Freshwater, 2017).",

Feasibility and implementation For the implementation of immunotherapy in the first line treatment of NSCLC, an extension of the treatment capacity at all levels is required in the short term. This applies à fortiori when the indication areas are extended, as is expected in the short term. If this is not done, the accessibility/accessibility of care to patients with incurable NSCLC may be compromised. This will also require an extension and improvement of the organization within the treating hospitals, but also an increasing degree of organizational impact within the current region of transplantation and networks and possibly also at the appropriate time. Racial/balance between the arguments for and against the intervention On the basis of the available randomised data with a moderate to low probative force, for specific patient groups with a non curative treatable NSCLC, there is also a benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab alone, a combination of platinum-pemetrexed pembrolizumab, a combination of carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumab or a combination of carboplatin-paclitaxel-pembrolizumab-pembrolizumab against platinum-doublet chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab.",

Considerations The following considerations and recommendations apply to the vast majority of the population to which the initial demand refers. Pros and cons of intervention and the quality of evidence The optimal choice of second-line treatment at a stage IV NSCLC patient is highly dependent on tumour characteristics, first-line treatment and performance score of the patient. Also, it is important to include the expected quality of life in the consideration. The individual studies studied have been performed in subgroups and in highly selected patients. Therefore, it is recommended to use a certain degree of caution in the interpretation of the results and projections. Head-to-head studies between the various recently developed means and strategies are lacking until now. The available randomized trials show shortcomings as mentioned above. As a result, there is a significant risk of bias and the GRADE scores for evidence of the studies downgrade. From derived data it can be said that this group of patients shows a reduced effect on survival, but these are only post-hoc data, where the various registration systems, reimbursement systems, and participation in studies may have significantly affected the score of an accurate performance. Also, the possible other quality of life in the use of immunotherapy in comparison with docetaxel is not sufficiently taken into account.",

Fehrenbacher (2018) provided results of an additional 7 months follow-up of the OAK trial. The included studies assessed the following immunotherapys; nivolumab (2 studies with a total of 854 patients), pembrolizumab (1 study with 1,034 patients) and atezolizumab (2 studies with a total of 1,137 patients). See table 1 and evidence tables for details of the studies. All studies included patients of multiple hospitals across different countries with and without sensitising oncogene drivers. Studies were used by the pharmaceutical industry. The median overall survival was 12.2 months for nivolumab versus 9.4 months for docetaxel in the CheckMate 057 trial and 9.2 months to 6.0 months in the CheckMate 017 trial. The pembrolizumab pooled HR for death was 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.77) compared to chemotherapy.

Nivolumab Versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Two-Year Outcomes From Two Randomized, Phase III Trials (CheckMate 01 and CheckMate 057). On the basis of extrapolation of data from the time frame before immune therapy was given an important role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, Docetaxel was chosen for treatment with docetaxel. Docetaxel was given as second-line treatment after platinum doublet, and is also recommended as second-line or third-line treatment after immune therapy and platinum doublet in current practice. This is additionally supported by the relatively good median overall survival in the docetaxel arm of the CodeBreak 200 study following chemoimmune therapy in KRAS G12c mutated patients (11.3 months, 95% CI 9.0-14.9 months) (De Langen, 2023) (see module accomplished incurable NSCLC with (rare) mutations for the extended description).After the search date for the literature summary (April 2023), at least two relevant RCTs were published comparing immune therapy with docetaxel after previous treatment with immune therapy.

Professional perspective There are no additional considerations from a professional perspective besides the above arguments. Patient perspective Some patients are open to treatments for which there is no direct evidence. It is important for patients to have open communication with their treatment providers and to be fully informed about the benefits and disadvantages of available treatment options. Joint decision-making between patient and care provider can help to choose treatments that fit the individual situation and preferences of the patient.

However, an MTB should be able to request expertise from a structural biologist but this expertise is not considered necessary at the moment for any MTB. The expertise of a pharmacist can sometimes be used for the optimal regulation of medication in compassionate use or off-label use. This person does not need to be present standard with the MTB, because the pharmacist can be especially involved after an opinion of the MTB. All the above states that the working group considers that in an MTB in which a treatment advice from an lung cancer patient is discussed at least a pulmonary doctor, a pulmonary pathologist and a KMBP, all three are employed in an expert centre for rare mutations in the treatment of lung cancer, should be present. Expertise should be claimed from a geneticist, a medical oncologist, a bioinformaticist, a structural biologist and a pharmacist. Which patients infer to the MTB? Predictive and diagnostic molecular pathology has become an important part of diagnosis of lung cancer patients. As described in module \"Predictive Tests\" from among others this directive, several predictive and diagnostic molecular biomarkers are currently known that have a direct consequence for a choice of targeted lung cancer therapy (see also Lindeman, 2018; Garinet, 2018). Overall, this concerns only a small number of predictive biomarkers that are relatively frequent (average >5%) in late-stage NSCLC (e.g. EGFR-exon19del, EGFR- p.(L858R) and KRAS-codon12/13 mutations). However, a significant proportion of the clinically relevant biomarkers have a detection frequency of <5% such as ALK-fusions (<3%) and ROS-fusions (<1%) for which are however registered therapy available (Tsao 2016). In parallel, the pharmaceutical industry regularly reports new drugs directed against a very wide range of specific genetic changes or against tumor-specific activated pathways not limited to lung cancer but which may also be affected in individual cases (see for example review by Tsao, 2016; Simon, 2013). In addition, there are increasingly different targeted substances available against genetic changes in the same gene mutation hotspots such as for example 5 drugs directed against mutations in codon 1151 to 1268 in ALK associated with ALK-TKI resistance (Gainor, 2016; Yoda, 2018) and dozens of anti-EGFR-TKI (next to erlotinib, gefintib, afatinib and osimertinib) for the 3 mutation hotspots (G719x, exon19del and L858R) (Ohashi, 2013; Loong, 2018). Without explicit knowledge, this information is unusable and we deny lung cancer patients a very serious possibility of optimal therapy with good response and low side effect versus pallitive standard therapy, a task that should explicitly be used by the MTB through the use of biological studies, rather than in clinical studies.",

Also, the organisation of accessibility was not described. References In patients in good overall condition with thoracic symptoms due to lung cancer (in consultation with the patient) a higher radiation dose (at least 30 Gy in 10 fractions) can be considered, because a higher dose may have a better effect on the general symptom burden and leads to better 1-year survival than a dose of <30 Gy. In patients in poor overall condition with thoracic complaints due to lung cancer (in consultation with the patient) a short radiation schedule (1 mple 5 fractions, dose <30 Gy) can be considered. The working group is considering the predominantly low quality of evidence of the available evidence that further research into the best peritoneal radiation regimen - in palliative radiotherapy for thoracic complaints in patients with NSCLC is desirable. In addition to symptom control, survival is also an objective of radiotherapy.Then a higher dose (10 x 3 Gy) should be considered and discussed with the patient (so-called metastatic decision making condition).In case of poor performance status, symptom palliation is in the foreground and should be preferred.Underbuilding Background Because most patients with metastatic lung carcinoma still die from their disease, often the demand for optimal palliation of complaints from intra-thoracic tumor (such as coughing, dyspnoea, pain, haemoptoesis) plays an important role in this.Radiotherapy plays a major role.Lightening of symptoms is obtained in 70- 80% of patients, with few side effects. Important toxicity occurs in less than 5% of patients: pneumonitis in 2-3%, nausea and vomiting and severe oesophagitis in less than 1%.In more than half of patients, the complaint for which radiotherapy is given for life-long duration is possible.",

For information and informed consent to molecular tumor diagnostics, a directive has been developed (for authorisation, publication expected mid-2023) at the initiative of the Association Clinical Genetics Netherlands (VKGN) with the support of the Netherlands Association for Pathology (NVVP).Lung cancer due to work Occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances is responsible for about 15% of all tumours of the entire respiratory tract in men and 5% in women. Lung cancer is most common (Gibson, 2013). Several chemicals have been identified that in occupational exposure give an increased risk of lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified 31 substances, exposures or work processes as category 1 carcinogens, i.e. they are carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 2021). For the substances asbestos, silica, diesel emission, chromium, arsenic, berillium and cadmium is known as the relationship between exposure to lung cancer (Loomis, 2018). A combined exposure to smoking and to harmful substances can have a carcinogenic effect. Long cancer by asbestos is one of the most common causes of asbestos. In determining the diagnosis of lung cancer, it is not yet possible from the medical diagnosis to determine on the basis of clinical, radiological or organoleptic characteristics whether lung cancer is caused by exposure to asbestos. Both the localization of malignancy in the lungs and the type of malignancy are not distinctive. The presence of so-called feline bridge diagnostics such as asbestososis and/or the presence of pleural plaques or pleural thickening can support the diagnosis. In particular, the historical work anamnesis will have to point out a possible work-related cause of lung cancer.",

In various group interventions for patients with cancer can also be experienced as supportive with fellow patients, especially by the recognition and experience (Grol, 2001; Vos, 1983). An additional difficulty is that the period of diagnosis is spiritually difficult for patients and close relatives and communication with patients is different than usual due to differences in coping styles and health skills between patients. Furthermore, it is necessary to give information dosed and to ensure that the patient receives for him understandable information. Consider visual support through animations and videos.

Considerations There are no considerations described.Underbuilding Summary of literature On the most appropriate file management in patients with NSCLC is not done. However, textbooks indicate what information can be collected and which may be relevant to medical thinking, including the preparation of a differential diagnosis. In addition, the information of the patient file can be used for national data files. There is no scientific data on how the dossier should look exactly, but the above considerations are common in medical training and practice. In this chapter, it is inventoried what can be recorded in the file of patients with lung cancer, based on what is needed in practice for a well-founded decision on treatments. In addition, there are some relevant protocols (including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database) available. Especially for the elderly is not clear whether all of the following data should be recorded. Much of the information below may be irrelevant to the individual patient, but most textbooks vary data on which are of interest to the lung cancer patient in general. Anamnese The anamnese is aimed at complaints that indicate enlargement and metastasization of the tumor, and on data on the operability of the patient.",

Research by Hill in 2003 shows that lung cancer patients (n=80) find that less than half of their concerns (43%) are discussed in the treatment team shortly after diagnosis (14-28 days) (2). Patients with lung cancer are more concerned about the psychosocial consequences of the disease than about the physical problems. The main concerns that patients discuss are: anxiety about the disease itself, concerns about the future regarding the well-being of their family. For example, Bozcuk describes in 50 patients the quality of life prior to chemotherapy treatment, the type of chemotherapy, and the age of the patient determine the extent of quality of life during treatment with chemotherapy (5). Especially elderly and patients with good quality of life prior to chemotherapy treatment, who do not respond to that treatment, are at greatest risk of a large decrease in their quality of life (6).",

      "text": "Patients can benefit from short-term interventions aimed at managing shortness of breath, nutrition, movement, increasing feeling of relaxation and maintaining family/family relationships (9) (10). In her review article, Ryan describes the proven effects of behavioural interventions of various physical complaints in patients with cancer such as pain, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy (10). Symptom management by nurses also requires time and space. Sikorskii describes in a randomized study (n=471) the value of automatic telephone symptom management compared to symptom management by a nurse (11). Both interventions show a clinically significant reduction in the severity of symptoms. Sikorskii was striking that patients with more severe adverse reactions withdrew from the automatic telephone contacts, probably because telephone intervention did not adequately provide adequate symptom management. Nevertheless, Cox describes that telephone symptom management could be a good complement to outpatient follow-up (12). Nurse's role in follow-up, although the follow-up in lung cancer patients seems important, regardless of the phase and treatment that the patient undergoes information and supervision, should be subject to a systematic treatment of any patient's treatment with reduced treatment. The guideline Kanker and Work from 2009 provides further information (13). For lung cancer patients treated in a curative scheme may pose problems for longer time after the end of treatment and therefore a programmatic approach in the aftercare as indicated by the directive on cancer recovery appears desirable (14). The role of the nurse in the coordination of care during their treatment will be affected by many aid providers. The complexity of the care is increasing and therefore a window or a point of contact is essential not to get lost as a patient in the maze of caregivers. A case manager is needed to ensure continuity. The (oncology) nurses, nursing specialists or realiser practitioners' can fulfil this role of case manager. They coordinate the logistics surrounding the treatment plan, his contact point for multidisciplinary teams and/or accompanying clinical scientific research. Continuity of care may be better provided by nurses than by the often smaller group of nurses with less team composition.

Baseline question What is the role of the different disciplines for the psychosocial oncological care of patients with NSCLC, from the moment of diagnosis to the moment of death? Recommendation Family doctor, medical specialist and (oncology) nurse should be aware that basic psychosocial care should be offered from the beginning of NSCLC diagnosis and treatment. This care consists of tailored information, adequate treatment and, if necessary, timely referral. For good psychosocial care, adequate referrals should be available to psychosocially oncologically skilled care providers such as nursing specialists, (hospital related) social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, and/or to specific patient programs (interview groups, rehabilitation programs, patient association). Level 3: C Schrameijer (1) Summary of literature For adequate guidance is a good coordination between the different treatment providers involved from the time of diagnosis to the time of death of great importance. Good communication, multidisciplinary consultation and transfers, both during hospitalisation and transfers from the second to the first line, are indispensable in all stages of diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial-oncological care is provided by all professionals with whom the patient is undergoing treatment in the oncological path. Many disciplines are involved in psychosocial care for patients with cancer, and their tasks depend on the expertise and the place in the care process (1) (2) (3). For the organization of psychosocial counseling, a funnel model can be used, in which a distinction is made between basic, specialized and professional care. If the patient is in need of general information on lung cancer, please refer to the website of the Long Cancer Information Centre In the case of genesis, it is necessary to inform the patient in a clear and respectful manner, to pay attention to the patient's treatment strategies and to explain risky conditions, hidden problems and bottlenecks in the patient, and to treat or refer to the patient at the right time Specialized psychosocial care In the case of permanent psychosocial complaints and/or psychosocial dysfunction, general practitioner, lung doctor, ward nurse and oncology nurse can offer specialized psychosocial care or, after inventory of the nature of the problem, refer (1) (2) Professional psychosocial assistance Finally, there are the professionals who are primarily engaged in psychosocial treatment from their field, such as (medical) social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, but also spiritual care providers.

Use an elastin staining in the determination of pleurainvasion. Considerations The TNM classification and stage classification is based on the prognostic significance of tumor characteristics of patients with lung cancer and not on therapy. In recent years, the database of patients with lung cancer has been extended, with a more proportional inclusion of patients around the world. Based on the current database of 94.708 patients (Rami-Porta, 2015 and Goldstraw, 2015) the T and M factor have been redefined and a new distribution is made on the basis of survival rates. This is the 8th edition of the TNM classification. The changes between the older and the most recent TNM classification are described. T-status Due to the differences in survival, when a difference is made in size per centimeter of 2 cm. Any involvement of the mediastinal fat, regardless of the involvement of vital structures, is defined as T4 in TNM 8. It should be noted that the TNM classification prognostic but does not have therapeutic implications for example with respect to resectability. Thorax wall infiltration including parietal pleura and superior sulcus tumors are classified with T3. Infiltration of the parietal pericardium and the n. phrenicus, in close anatomical relationship with the border mediastinal/ lung, are still seen as T3. Figure 1 Overview of pT1 to 4,N0,R0 differences in prognosis (Source: Rami-Porta, 2016) The tumor size is measured in clinical stadiums in lung setting: the (maximum length), longest diameter in one of the three directions (axial, sagitaal or coronal) determines the T stage. In subsole noduli determines the length of the solid component in lung setting the clinical T stage. Furthermore, two new T categories for early cancers are introduced. For patients with multiple tumor noduli, the classification is based on the following four patterns: a) tumors with different morphology, PET-avidity and histology must be classified separately; b) two tumor noduli of the same tumor type are T3 if they are in the same lobe, T4 if they are in the same lung and M1a if they are in both lungs; c) multiple mat glass lesions with dominant lepid tumor growth are classified on the basis of the dominant laesis with a m for multiplicity; d) a lepidally growing piecepneumonic type is classified (similar to b (see above)) as T3 if limited to one lobe, as T4 if in two unilateral lobes and as M1a if both lungs are involved (Detterbeck, 2016). The classification for the T-status is described in table 1 Table 1 Overview of T-status according to 8th TNM classification.",

Smoking is the main factor, especially for small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. For adenocarcinoma, besides smoking air pollution is an important contributing factor. According to a large European study, the lung cancer risk is associated with air pollution (HR 1.22; 95% CI., 1.03-1.45) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM. That risk is lower than the risk of smoking for which the relative risk is 23.3 and 12.7 respectively the current male and female smokers [Raschou-nielsen 2013(9)]. However, the overall risk of air pollution is high, given that everyone is exposed to this.",

Diagnostic compute tomography (CT) A diagnostic CT of the thorax is a multi-detector CT consisting of an acquisition with an intravenous contrast, performed from the supraclavicular region to the adrenal glands. All patients with suspected or proven NSCLC are eligible for this. It is recommended that the diagnostic CT be scanned in the portal phase or before the bronchoscopy is scanned or immediately after the PET/CT examination. The diagnostic CT should be performed with intravenous contrast agent in which the supraclavicular region to the adrenal glands are depicted.

CT sensitivity for the detection of neck gland metastases is 67-88% with an increase in sensitivity when CT is combined with FDG-PET (92%). Demonstrating these N3 glands provides relatively simple tissue diagnosis. Although the use of intravenous contrast does not improve the detection of mediastinal lymph nodes, the detection of hilitary glands is not desirable, the local expansion of the primary tumor, vascular ingrowth and the difference between tumor and poststenototic atelectase or obstruction pneumonia is improved.

Whether the matt glass component should be involved, is unclear. The lymph nodes are measured in the crusted axis. Follow-up measurements should take place under the same conditions (windowsetting and coupe thickness). The use of multi-detector CT techniques and MPRs lead to a better assessment of tumor expansion, such as through the growth of tumor through the fissure, the extent of expansion in the visceral pleura and/or the thor wall, a better differentiation of barrels by tumor in diameter and greater accuracy of the scale.",

Whether this is feasible depends on local conditions, such as the logistics surrounding access to the FDG-PET-CT, the access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the FDG-PET-CT device, the possibility of contrast administration and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear-medical assessment. Preferably, the FDG-PET with a diagnostic CT should result in an integrated nuclear-medical radiological report.

If liver and adrenals have been examined in the initial CT, therefore it is a separate study of bone and brain metastases (2).

However, often a puncture or biopsy is needed to provide certainty. The same applies to liver abnormalities where imaging research is not considered conclusive (9). FDG-PET is used to demonstrate (occulte) metastases that are simplified for pathological verification. Only for the absence of FDG uptake in an enlarged adrenal gland is not described to date error-negativity (95% CI: 0.95-1.0) (10) (11) (12) (13). Conversely, there is no (light) increased absorption in adrenal adenomas, and here too, the value of a positive test depends on the tip (specificity: 0.88; 95%-BI: 0.78-0,94) (13). For typing brain abnormalities, FDG-PET by the high physiological FDG uptake in the brain has no value (14).",

In patients with impaired lung function, several studies have shown that with a quantitative lung perfusion scan, the FEV and TLCO can be estimated from the residual function after 1 a pulmonary resection (FEV pre-dicted postoperative' (ppo) and the TLCO ppo) (14) (15) (16).

However, 1 patients with a FEV below this median value needed more frequent oxygen. In two other studies 1 with patients with a mean FEV ppo of 31% and 24% respectively of the predicted value, 1 described good results (no increased perioperative mortality) of lobectomy of a poorly perfused lobe and of pulmonary volume reduction surgery combined with resection of suspicious nodules (29) (30).

Other The treatment and co-treaters will, on the basis of the above data, conclusions and recommendations, together with the other clinical data and the nature of the proposed operation, have to assess the perioperative risk. To anticipate unexpected peroperative findings that require a more extensive resection than expected, it is wise to pre-operatively decide what degree of parenchymresection seems appropriate; is also a bilobectomy or pneumonectomy functionally possible? The high mortality of a right pneumonectomy after prior to treatment should be explicitly considered. If the risk is increased, the team of treatmentrs must decide whether this risk is acceptable, or whether the preference should be given to alternatives such as a more limited resection or re- and/or radiotherapy.",

A recent Dutch study shows that a panel of additional colors on biopsies allows a better differentiation between adeno- and squamous cell differentiation: cytokeratine 7 and TTF1 colouring helps to be adenodifferentiation, and p63 for squamous differentiation [Thunnissen 2011(24) ].",

Given that the studies show in particular the performance of the compared techniques in relation to individual genes, no definite statement can be made on the cumulative number of mutations that would be demonstrated or missed over a set of different genes, although it is likely that broad testing using NGS will lead to the discovery of a larger number of predictive mutations for targetted therapy.Source:Row 15:\n.",

It is unclear what the spectrum of resistance mutations is determined to achieve survival gains in the current situation for these patients.

However, until this informs the decision-making on additional therapy on the basis of prospective studies (such as in mammacarcinoma and melanoma) it is doubtful whether the anxiety caused by the patient by detected micrometastases and the cost and personnel load for the pathology laboratories by an appropriate method outweighs the benefits of potentially better prognostic accuracy. .",

Then a pneumonectomy will be considered. However, a pneumonectomy has a much higher morbidity and mortality than a lobectomy. In a recent study of 485 patients similar percentages were found (15). The postoperative mortality after a pneumonectomy was 8% and after a lobectomy 2, one small study was known for the results of a pneumonectomy with a partial resection 6.2% and after a lobectomy with a 2.9%. The series showed that 5-8% of the total number of interventions is eligible for a \"sleeve\"-lobectomy (31).

The TNM stage is determined according to the 7th classification of Goldstraw (see TNM classification). In addition, it is also determined whether a complete curative resection is possible. Correct information about the extension of the process optimizes the probability of a complete resection. Furthermore, intraoperative urbanization is of importance for determining the prognosis and the setting of adjuvant therapy. If the tumor peroperative irresectable appears, urbanization is especially important for determining a new treatment plan. Comparison of different treatment modes is possible only in the case of a correct urbanization. In this context, four locations are likely to be distinguished from Rogalo bronchial', i.e. from Roalo mucosaal', or from Roalo pierbronchial' (i.e.: outside the cartilage), and Roalo extrabronchial', which is further named in the vessels or in the thorax wall (and the hilus) ' (1) (2) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9).

One of the starting questions was focused on this and reflected below.Row 6:\nPleural lavageRow 7:\nPleural lavage A positive lavage is more commonly found at a higher TNM stage and is associated with a worse prognosis (46) (47) (52) (49) (49) (50).

In interpreting these study results, account should be taken of the period during which these studies have been carried out. It is important to note that they have been carried out before the introduction of the pre-operative FDG-PET. In determining a position on mediastinal lymph node dissection versus mediastinal lymph node sample, consideration should also be given to the fact that a definition \"complete resection' has been formulated by both IASLC (Rami Porta) and the European Society for Thoracic Surgery (ESTS) (de Leyn). In the ESTS definition, an mediastinal lymph node dissection is a condition for speaking of a complete resection.

In the majority of patients there has been a locoregional or systemic relapse causing this worse survival than those controls. Since the early 1980s clinical research on the value of adjuvant chemotherapy for this patient category has been conducted. The 1995 meta-analysis finds a survival benefit for patients who received cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (1). In this meta-analysis, the absolute survival benefit is 5%. Because the survival benefit is not significant (HR 0.87, p=0.08) it was not sufficient for many researchers at the time to apply adjuvant chemotherapy in practice. In the past 5 years five major phase-III studies have been published (3) (6) (7). In subset analyses there was a survival benefit when the tumour was greater than 4 cm (in the new IASLC classification at least T2a (3-5 cm) or T2b (5-7 cm) diameter.

Radiotherapy with 40-50 Gy showed survival gains after one year in patients with locally expanded NSCLC compared to no radiotherapy (18% versus 14%; p = 0,05)473. In a small three-arm study in which 118 patients were randomised to radiotherapy with 50 Gy, or the same radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or good supportive care, the median survival increased in the active treated groups: 53 and 52 weeks versus 34 weeks, but the differences were not statistically significant218. Despite this gain, the treatment has not been widely followed up by this treatment because the treatment has a number of pragmatic concerns: three times a day treatment with six hours of time interval over a continuous period of 12 days.",

At present, among radiotherapists consensus is that the standard radiotherapy scheme in locally expanded NSCLC consists of a biological total dose of at least 60 Gy. Currently, elective irradiation of unsaved cling stations is increasingly under discussion. Arguments for irradiation of only pathological findings on PET-CT or in EUS, EBUS or mediastinaloscopy are assessed: there is rarely an isolated gland recurrence, the combination with chemotherapy is more toxic than the radiation field becomes larger, and an isolated recurrence is rarely seen in a recent evaluation of four RTOG studies. Modern image-controlled radiotherapy techniques such as IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy allow better shielding of the healthy tissues and achieves a sharper dose waste than with 3D conformation radiotherapy.",

Only if a complete resection can be performed (R0), surgery should be done. Staying tumor (R1) is prognostically unfavourable. Radiotherapy prior to surgery, often referred to as the standard in sulcus superior tumors, is largely based on old literature. An argument for preoperative radiotherapy is that the surgery to be performed involves such morbidity that success of this procedure should be assured in advance. However, preoperative radiotherapy does not improve survival in other groups of patients with an NSCLC (3) (4) (5). With a radiotherapy dose between 55 and 65 Gy after incomplete resection increases the probability of local control and survival compared to the probability after a dose between 45 and 55 Gy (6). There were 27% stage IIB, 8% stage IIIA, 42% stage IIIB and 23% stage IV patients.",

In none of the operated patients there was a local relapse. This pathological complete remission rate is similar to that of the previously mentioned study. To determine the optimal combination treatment of this tumor there are no prospectively randomised studies available. On the one hand, we can assume that a sulcus superior tumor can be considered as any other NSCLC. On the other hand, a more aggressive approach seems to justify, given the localization with often difficult treatment complaints if no local control is achieved. A multimodal approach with concomitant chemotherapy and/or surgery appears to provide the best results on the basis of the current data. In patients whose primary sulcus superior tumor does not appear to be primary resectable (clinical stage III), concomitant chemradiotherapy is advised.",

The Respiratory Corrected CT scan (RCCT) or 4D-CTscan in preparation for irradiation treatment has been clinically used on all irradiation departments in the Netherlands. This technique allows the breathing movement of the lung tumour to be captured during the planning CT scan. In the irradiation plan, this information is taken into account, allowing the radiation to be directed more precisely at the tumor. By making available better algorithms for calculating the dose in homogenic tissue (extremely important in lung tissue) it could be started with intensity-modulated irradiation (IMRT) [Govaert 2012(48)]. A major step forward because with this technique the dose of waste outside the target volume becomes sharper, and the compliance to the target area is significantly increased [DRRT 2005(51].",

It is known that in a significant number of patients the diagnosis of NSCLC is made on very small biopts of 2mm or less. In one study, this number was 14.6% (Bigras, 2018). Another argument is that of all patients receiving chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, more than half are no longer entitled to a form of second-line treatment and therefore not to the potential benefits of immunotherapy (Davies, 2017; Lazzari, 2017). Nevertheless, the evidence for adding immunotherapy to treatment in this patient category is limited and chemotherapy treatment alone is certainly also a good option to discuss with patient.Row 11:\n Row 12:\nPDF created on 23-01-2025 205/428",

It is unclear what the influence has been of whether or not adequate urbanisation in the studies of Gomez (2016) and Iyengar (2018).Row 5:\n Row 6:\nThe probative force is small because both RCTs randomized a small number of patients. The largest study (Gomez, 2016) was stopped early by the IDMC because there was a clear improvement in progression of free survival which made it undesirable to continue the study. The other RCT (Iyengar, 2018) was also stopped. There is no phase III trial that shows that a radical treatment after systemic treatment improves the survival of these patients compared to systemic therapy alone.Row 7:\n Row 8:\nAnother disadvantage of the available literature are the inclusion criteria for treatment of oligometastases (maximum number of metastases total, maximum number of metastases per organ, count of mediastinal lymph node metastases in total, well/no presence of driver aberrations), and the time of radical local treatment (concurrent with systemic treatment or only after response to induction systemic treatment) (Giaj-Levra, 2019). This makes comparing studies difficult. Furthermore, although mostly up to 5 metastases are allowed and mediastinal lymph node metastases are not an exclusion criterion, often only patients with 1 to 12 metastases without N2 or N3 disease are included in clinical trials (Giaj-Levra, 2019).

The chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin for four cycles followed by osimertinib + pemetrexed. The primary endpoint PFS showed a significant improvement in the combination therapy arm compared to monotherapy (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.79; p<0.0001). The median PFS improved by 8.8 months; BICR PFS assessment even showed a 9,5 month improvement in the ≥3 AES were 64% in the combination therapy arm and 27% in the monotherapy arm.

Osimertinib, as monotherapy, is known for its urinary use by oral administration and has a relatively favorable side effect profile with less hospital visits and possibly better quality of life.However, the combination of erlotinib and ramucirumab in certain subgroups can be more effective, but requires regular infutures and probably leads to increased toxicity.This consideration requires a serious consideration of the clinical effectiveness and personal preferences of the patient.",

In this module, an argument is given as to why this makes sense for the rare mutations. In the module 'First line treatment incurable NSCLC with EGFR exon 19/21 mutation', an argument is given for the purpose of EGFR exon19 deletions and EGFR exon21 L858R-point mutations. The reason is that all of these drivers are rare, also a part is only relatively recently identified as driver. However, among all drivers the ORR is high, and PFS/median duration of response is long in targeted therapy.Pow 12: . .Row 13:\nValues and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) .Row 14:\nALK: benefit of TKIs is that these are given orally and that patient should not be for an infusion with chemotherapy to the hospital.

A significant correlation between the duration of the delay and an increase in tumour size could not be demonstrated in this study. However, a study in the Netherlands showed that the waiting period between chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulted in significant tumour growth (14). Elsewhere, a retrospective study found that the duration of treatment (defined as time between referral and first treatment) did not affect survival (9). Further research has been done into the influence of the interval between the diagnosis and the time of operation (10). The length of the interval does not correspond to the tumour stage at the time of operation. The indication of chemotherapy for NSCLC is not considered in this chapter. It can be concluded that no clear relationship has been established between withdrawal periods in the diagnostic and therapeutic phase of the NSCLC and the prognosis.

This conclusion is contrary to what has been found in patients with head-neck tumours after surgery. In this patient group it has been shown that postoperative delay of radiotherapy has a detrimental effect on the local recurrence rate (17). Psychosocial stress Delay in the diagnostic or therapy pathway causes psychosocial stress in patients with cancer. This finding has been investigated in patients with a breast cancer or a head-halstumour (18) (19) (20) (22) (22) (22) (22).

During this period significant differences were found in number and type of resections and in the application of chemoradiation. Also in survival differences were demonstrated. Although a significant correlation was found with the diagnostic volume and availability of radiotherapy the variation between the hospitals under investigation was greater (5). In order to ensure optimal and continuous care, requirements should be imposed on the number of interventions carried out annually and on the minimum number of specialists and nurses (6).",

Eventually, Dutch patients benefit from the most informed decision and then the best treatment. This can only be done through concentration of care. For radiotherapy, it is provided by a limited number of irradiation centres and is equally desirable for surgery. The current requirements do not take into account the larger surgical numbers needed for optimal minimal invasive surgery (VAT) on one side and technically extensive and complex resections on the other side. Therefore, the combination of patient care, education and research is an important aspect of a center.The following criteria can be applied to a center: \"Row 16\": \"Row 17\": 1. In a center to increase knowledge and experience, a minimum of 25 patients is treated appropriate to the prevalence of lung cancer and to the level of multidisciplinary care required. 2.The center is capable of providing highly specialized complex patient care with a multidisciplinary thorax-oncological team. 3.The center is capable of specialized diagnostics: nuclear research, endooesophageal and endobrochial ultrasound, MRI and FDG-PET (see Diagnostics). 4.The center is capable of handling: use of certain facilities of another hospital or other institution with the aim of ensuring optimal treatment.

In her review article Ryan describes the proven effects of behavioural interventions of various physical complaints in patients with cancer such as pain, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy (10). Symptom management by nurses also requires time and space. Sikorskii describes in a randomised study (n=471) the value of automatic telephone symptom management compared to telephone symptom management by a nurse (11). Both interventions show a clinically significant reduction in the severity of symptoms. However, it was striking that patients with lung cancer who have more severe side effects withdrew from the automatic telephone contacts, probably because telephone intervention does not adequately provide adequate symptom management. Cox describes that telephone symptom management could be a good complement to outpatient follow-up (12).
