For the purpose of p p p a p p p and p p p p and and and and and p p p The treatment program has been updated annually by the healthcare provider in the autumn.The clinical treatment program has been revised by the national treatment team and has been in place in the fall.The treatment programme has been in place for the first time in the fall. The treatment programme has been revised to include a reduction in the number of patients receiving treatment in the first half of the year. The treatment programme has been improved by a reduction in the number of patients receiving treatment in the second half of the year. This revision includes a discussion on pre- and perioperative chemoimmune therapy in localised and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a recommendation on treatment choices if such treatment is planned. Furthermore, the chapter on drug treatment in metastatic lung cancer has been updated with a current literature review of recommended indications for targeted treatment.",

The age-standardised incidence of lung cancer was up to 2016 higher among men, but the difference has declined over time, and the incidence is slightly higher among women over the past five years.

The increased risk has only been established in smokers, which supports an assumption of synergy between ionising radiation and smoking.

Considered as a separate diagnosis, lung cancer in people who have never smoked anyway had been the 7th most common cause of cancer death in the world [12]. Never-smokers' tumours, which are almost always adenocarcinoma, have been suggested to have their own tumour biology with, among other things, lower rates of proliferation and with overall fewer changes in the tumour genome. That lung cancer in never-smokers (in studies commonly defined as having smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in total) more often show some of the tumour-driven mutations or gene fusions that enable treatment with targeted therapy have probably contributed to the increased awareness of this particular patient group in recent years. Although the number of never-smokers with lung cancer has increased in absolute numbers during the time these data were recorded in the national lung cancer register (2002 and onwards), the proportion of never-smokers in lung cancer cases would have been relatively unchanged (about 15% for women and 10% for men) during the same period [13].",

If DT brain with contrast media is not conclusive, MRI brain should be performed. In SCLC, 10-15 % asymptomatic brain metastases have been diagnosed [58]. In other cases, DT/MRT brain is made for clinical signs of brain metastases. MRI has higher sensitivity to detect small brain metastases and leptometal carcinomatosis, and should be chosen if detection of such is crucial for the management. Finding of solitary or single brain metastases on DT should be verified with MRI, when surgery or stereo-taktic radiation treatment of the metastases may be considered if the spread is limited.

By increasing the number of treatment fractions (hyperfraction) or shortening the total duration of treatment (accelerating), the effect of the given treatment can be increased by reducing the induction of DNA repair and tumour cell repopulation. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, the UK CHART study early showed that an accelerated treatment with 1.5 Gy given continuously three times a day to a final dose of 54 Gy resulted in better survival than conventional treatment by 2 Gy daily to the final dose of 60 Gy [132]. A meta-analysis from 2012 of 10 studies, mainly conducted in the 1990s, found a small but significant benefit for accelerated or hyperfractionated treatment [133], but the lack of modern randomised studies involving chemotherapy allows evidence of accelerated treatment today to be considered insufficient.",

A meta-analysis in limited disease published in 1999 showed a survival gain of 5.4% at 3 years with the addition of PCI in patients who responded to treatment [175]. PCI should not be administered concomitant with chemotherapy as the risk of neurocognitive adverse events increases. PCI is recommended in patients in good partial or complete tumour emission after completion of radiochemotherapy. For elderly patients (> 80 years) or patients with cerebrovascular disease there is an increased risk of adverse reaction, and there is a choice to refrain from PCI.

Fistulas to oesophagus are suspected primarily of meal-related symptoms in the form of productive cough after food intake. The fistula should be mapped with DT and bronchoscopy. In the case of fistulas to main bronchial or trachea, attempts can be made to seal these with stent from either the oesophagus side or the airway side. More peripheral fistulas are difficult to cover with stent. Instead, attempts can be made to octulate segments or lobbronc with endobronchial valves.

However, how the boundaries between different levels are made in practice is not entirely self-evident. Therefore, all health professionals need to have a responsiveness to the needs and expectations of the patient and what of this they want to have help with. When it comes to needs that transcend their own competence or ability, it should be offered to the patient to help establish contact with a team member or rehabilitation team that can meet these needs [345]. In the case of lung cancer, it is common for patients to undergo emotional experiences of loss, despair, anxiety and fear. This question can be asked regularly, not only when the patient shows crisis and grief reactions, since it is ultimately about the patient's own motivation and readiness to receive help. The curator is the team member who specifically stands for and focuses on the psychosocial perspective of cancer care. The primary task of the curator is to promote patients' and relatives' living conditions.

Fluid in the pleural sac is common in these earlier stages, but then disappears when the pleura leaves grow together. Computer tomography shows an irregular pleural thickening, which is most pronounced basal. Typical is that there is a lot of connective tissue in the tumor, and when the tumor grows the pleura becomes thicker but at the same time it also becomes a contraction of the thoracic half, which becomes immobilized. It is sometimes hard to treat severe pain. Metastases can be seen quite early on computer tomography. On PET or computer tomography you can see spread to mediatinal lymph nodes. However, as in the case of all malignant tumors, the chest itself can be invaded, and then you can get a sometimes difficult treatment of severe pain. Metastases are seen mainly in needle ducts and surgical tomography.",

Patients treated with curative intent should be followed to detect treatmentable relapses, treatment-related complications or a new primary lung cancer. Apart from a small undersized study, there are no prospective comparative studies where the question of what is the most effective follow-up of these patients has been studied [436]. How often and by which methods follow-up are guided, in particular, by knowledge of relapse patterns, not by evidence that previous detection and treatment of relapse leads to a better result. At least two thirds of relapse occurs during the first 2 to 3 years after treatment [437). Therefore, the controls are more frequent during these years.",

The lung cancer association is primarily aimed at those who have received lung cancer, but also to relatives and others who think that work for improved care, treatment, treatment and survival in lung cancer is important. The lung cancer association's vision is that no one should die in lung cancer! We also work to get rid of stigmatisation – everyone can suffer from lung cancer! We work for a fair and equal cancer care, for shorter waiting periods and for more research around lung cancer. An important goal is to become more members of the association. Patient association was started in 2004 with the aim of providing support to those who have received lung cancer. For this reason, it was then named the support. After a number of years with small economic resources, the organisation had grown so much more time and for more research on lung cancer. You will need to review the national differences in lung cancer care in order to find out what is the reason for the great inequality we see today.

The risk of suffering from lung cancer after exposure to radon is particularly high in smokers. • Innate genetic factors probably contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer in a part of the population. Apart from rare genetic syndromes, knowledge of hereditary lung cancer is less than in diseases such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. • Diet factors are likely to have some significance for the risk of developing lung cancer. A high intake of fruit and vegetables has been shown in epidemiological studies to reduce the risk of cancer, including lung cancer.",
