The molecular characterization of the tumour has thus become a determining criterion in the choice of therapeuhque strategy. It allows to restrict the prescriphon of a number of treatments to the only suscephble pahents of benefit and thus to reduce the number of treatments inuhles, toxic and expensive.

The fact that a drug has a MAH does not mean that it is available and refunded in France. The High Health Authority (HAS) gives an opinion on the refund and then the Nahonal Health Insurance Fund (NAMI) decides on the refund. In case of reimbursement, the price is then negotiated with the industrial. This process can be lengthy. Before the MAH or between the MAH and the decision to refund made by the CNAM, there are in some cases early access availabilities, issued by the Nahonal Agency for the Safety of Medicine and Health Products (ANSM): compassionate access authorization (AAC) or early access authorization (APA) and early access authorizations post-AMM.",

      "text": "The deployment of new generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the analysis of multiple molecular alterations constituting potential therapeutic targets. In the case of the analysis of solid tumours, a minimum list of 16 genes has been published by INCa2 for routine use. DNA NGS (DNAseq) is not always sufficient to analyze all required biomarkers, and complementary techniques are deployed in clinical prahc, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the study of protein expression such as PD-L1 and ALK, or NGS sequencing on RNA (RNAseq) for the research of fusion transcripts. Furthermore, while the search for these molecular anomalies remains classically carried out on the tumour tissue-based techniques (i.e., recombinant) for the study of the expression of proteins such as PD-L1 and ALK, an alternative biological source, generically called \"liquid biopsy\" is increasingly used. This term refers to the isolation of biological material released by the tumour in the bodily fluids, the search for these molecular anomalies is more likely to result in the process of the biological process of the process of process of process of the process. 2 Minimum gene lists to be analyzed in the context of a diagnostic use of the NGS (February 2016), available for download on cancer.fr Therefore, the choice of the test strategy to be performed must take into account the following issues: • research all biomarkers allowing patients to have access to the treatments they could benefit from, including in clinical trials, so as not to lead to loss of chance; • manage the amount of existing tumour tissue to be able to perform all the tests necessary for therapeutic decision-making and/or to plan liquid biopsies; • ensure that all the necessary molecular tests are carried out within a time frame compatible with the start of the treatment of patients; • ensure the quality of the molecular tests carried out taking into account the performance of the techniques used. This document presents the conclusions of the expert group on the test strategy to be put in place in patients with CBNPC for an optimal care strategy at all stages of the disease (considering the data available on the day of writing of the document). This document also does not contain any recommendations on how to carry out the tests, but only the techniques to be used when there are several techniques to be used for the same biomarker. The tests must be carried out according to the good practices of anatomopathology and molecular biology. These recommendations of tests to be carried out are to be discussed at multidisciplinary consultation meeting (MCP) and/or molecular staff, according to the local organization, especially depending on the possible access to clinical trials. The conduct of tests to allow the inclusion of patients in clinical trials is recommended. Unless otherwise mentioned, these test recommendations concern patients with NSCLC, apart from the epidermoid carcinomas of the smoking patient.",
