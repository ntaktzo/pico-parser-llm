However, in both countries, the incidence rate in women seems to stabilize over the last few years. Despite the decline in incidence rates among men, the incidence rate for Germany is expected to continue to increase in view of the increasing incidence in women and demographic development until 2022. However, in Germany and other countries, the incidence rates in both sexes are likely to increase. In the case of women, there is no significant relationship between re- gional socio-economic status and lung cancer. An explanation would be that socio-economic differences in smoking behaviour in women have only developed later, towards the end of the 20th century. [4] Finally, the socioeconomic status is correlated with survival after diagnosis. The individual income is inversely associated with letality [6]. A low regional socio-eco-nomical status is associated with a lower 5-year excess rate among women in Germany as well as with a lower 5-year excess rate [11], [12]. In the international comparison, a opposite relationship is observed: New disease and death rates are associated with letality [6]. A lower regional socio-economic status is associated with a lower 5-year excess rate in countries with higher life expectancy, higher education, higher gross human health product (H] is more common.

In the following sections, the opinion of the The higher the risk of smoking, the higher the risk of smoking. • The higher the risk of smoking, the higher the risk of smoking. • The higher the risk of smoking, the higher the risk. • The higher the risk of smoking, the higher the risk of smoking for both men and women. • Smoking increases the risk for all histological cell types. • In 2013, about 25 percent of the German population smoked at the age of 18 years, and about three quarters of the smokers took part daily in the cigarette [19]. Although there were still significantly more men (30 percent) than women (20 percent) smoking in the German adult population, in the case of adolescents and young adults, smoking rates between the sexes, due to an increase in female smokers, were largely similar to one in the age of 12 and 17 years of age, the higher the number of children in the international comparison, the higher the average for children and the average for children.

Consensus Epidemiological studies (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, occupational and medical exposures) have clearly demonstrated in the dose range above 100 mSv that ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer linearly, without taking the dose into account. For example, in the case of a patient who has undergone an X-ray exposure, the exposure to X-ray exposure is not limited to 2 days. In the case of a patient who has undergone an X-ray exposure, the exposure to X-ray exposure is not limited to 2 days. In the case of a patient who has undergone an X-ray exposure, the exposure to X-ray exposure is limited to 2 days. The exposure to X-ray exposure is limited to 2 days. In the case of a radiological survey, the radiological survey carried out by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, and the radiological survey carried out by the Ministry of the Environment, has revealed in recent years that the medical exposure to radiation has increased due to the growing use of CT studies [88]. The scientific advisory body of the Federal Environment Ministry, the Radiological Protection Commission, has found that from the age of 100 to 200 Bq/m3 there is a statistically significant increase in the rate of lung cancer caused by radon. The idea of prevention requires measures to protect against radon below this threshold of significance. Basically, the radon concentration in residential areas can be reduced by increased ventilation or ventilation. However, in particular in the winter, the heat loss should be assessed with regard to higher radon concentrations.

In the case of the patient to have a high risk of the disease, the patient to have a high risk of the disease and the patient to have a high risk of the disease. In the case of the patient to have a high risk of the disease, the number of patients to be screened (number needed to screen) determines the average number of people to be exposed to the risk of the disease, but does not have any potential benefit, 1 picture giving of the procedure 86 and is also a key determinant of the average financial cost per age of the disease, which can be obtained by a screening program. The two dimensions along which lung cancer screening can be programmatically optimized are therefore the definitions of an optimal risk of lung cancer, which can also be taken by the patient to have a low risk of the disease. In the United States, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended 2013 shortly after the publication of the NLST results [158] in annual lung cancer screening with low dose CT for US adults aged 55–80 years with a cumulative exposure of 30 pack years and an active or previous nico- tinabusus within the last 15 years [194]. This corresponds to the inclusion criteria used in the NLST study, but with an extension of the maximum exposure age from 75 to 80 years. In 2021, after the publication of the outcomes of the NELSON study, the USPSTF updated its recommendation and thus reduced the minimum age for screening from 55 years to 50 years as well as the cumulative exposure from 20 to 20 years. For example, in the case of one of the above cases, the maximum number of hours of exposure to the exposure to exposure to exposure to As a result of this, there are likely to be a significant number of people who would actually benefit from a cancer-related disease-related disease-related disease-related disease-related-related disease-related disease-related disease-related disease-related-related-related disease-related disease-related disease-related disease-related disease- For example, for example, in the case of the disease of the population.

Is the screening program effectively focused on those individuals who will benefit from the screening session of the screening session. And do those who meet the eligibility criteria use it effectively? 2. How often does the screening effectively reduce the incidence of lung cancer-related mortality among the screening participants and increases the life expectancy of those with tumours discovered in the screening session? 4. To what extent does the program reduce lung cancer-related mortality at the level of the overall population? 5. How high is the overall cost effectiveness or the monetary value per year of life gained?

The general condition of the disease is not to be met by TM. In this case the diagnosis of the disease is only symptomatic for the implementation of palliative measures. A minimal difference between SCLC and NSCLC is that for the metastatic stage a subdivision of the stage IV in IVA and IVB is not necessary [400]. TNM classification The clinical classification of the tumours by their spread locally, regionally and remotely allows a pragmatic handling of the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The comparison of results of clinical studies and the evaluation of registers is only possible by classification of tumors. Thus, the classification of the tumours according to their degree of spread is not to be examined by COPD. The following are the following: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemire: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vemire: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimire: Vemire: Vemire: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vemire: Vemire: Vemire: Vxie: Vinitrile: Vxie: Vxie: Vimire: Vimire: Vxile: Vxie: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: ViniI: Vini: Vemi: Vinire: Vxie: Vxie: Vinitrile: Vinitrile: Vinitrile: Vxie: Vini: Vemi: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: Vinitri: Vxie: Vxie: Vini: Vxie: Vin: Vin: Vin: • For each localization, 2 classifications may be described: • Clinical classification: the pretherapeutic clinical classification, described as TNM (or cTNM), is important for the selection and evaluation of the therapy. • They are based on pre-treatment findings. These are based on clinical examination, imaging procedures, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration and other relevant examinations. • Pathological classification: the postoperative histopathological classification, called pTNM, is used for the indication for adjuvant therapy and provides additional data to estimate the prognosis and calculate final results. In this classification, the pre-treatment findings are supplemented or modified by findings obtained during the surgical procedure and through the pathological examination. If you want to know more about metastasis, then you need to know more about metastasis. If you want to know more about metastasis, you need to know more about metastasis. M-diagnosis of a single tumor is not to be used in the same category as TNM-classification, but not in the same category as TNM-classification. • pMx: can not be used • pM0: can only be used after autopsies • pM1: can also be used after cytological or histological biopsies (e.g. after puncture of a liver metastasis of a lung carcinoma with ipsilateral LK-MTS cT3cN2pM1b(HEP). • Metastases in lymph nodes that are not close to the regional lymph nodes are classified as remote metastasis.",

Treatment of lung carcinoma with infiltration of the upper thoracic aperture consists of a combined radio-chemotherapy and possibly secondary resection, regardless of the depth of infiltration (at least pleura parietalis), which is difficult to determine in individual cases. Therefore, the term pancoast tumor can be used for the detection of infiltration of the pleura parietalis above the second rib. The extent of the disease varies in these tumours and should be classified according to the known rules. An invasion of the vertebral body or the spinal canal or a walling of the subclavia vessel or an advanced involvement of upper branches of the plexus brachialis (C8 or above) is not classified as T4. If none of these criteria is present, the tumor is classified as T3 as a small number of Tku.",

Consensus 7.3 Specific A Enlightenment Situations 192 Consensus-based recommendation of the patient is to be examined in their role as supporters and co-affected persons. They are to be asked about their needs and encouraged, if necessary, to accept assistance offers. Consensus Background As soon as the diagnosis of a lung carcinoma is secured, the patient is to be clarified by the treating physician. It is up to the patient's discretion whether the partner, family member or third party should be involved. Promoted for the guidance of the patient is to be actively listening and expressing empathy as well as the encouragement of the patient to express his feelings and ask questions. For example, the patient should be informed of the patient's truth and the patient's opinion in the patient's opinion. The session will take place within 2 hours of each meeting. The session will take place within 2 days of your request. The session will take place within 2 hours of your request. The session will take place within 2 days of your request and will take place within 2 days of your request. In addition to giving an opinion on the subject, the following questions should be asked: - how to give an opinion on the subject, - how to give an opinion on the subject. Most patients do not want to be informed about the response to the patient. The objective of the forward-looking care planning is the best possible implementation of the individual preferences of the patient and his/her relatives. These preferences do not only relate to the overall therapeutic objective (life extension and/or quality of life in a pahliative clinical scenario). The following are some of the major challenges in the treatment of patients with an unhealable cancer: the expression of a death/death wish of a patient with an unhealable cancer should be met with empathy and willingness to talk.

[401] 3 Stadi ium I//II 214 The standard definition of the surgical fatality refers to deaths within 30 days postoperative. It is also referred to as perioperative lethality. The surgery morbidity defines undesirable consequences of the operation within 30 days postoperative. It can be divided into minor and serious consequences. A systematic overview work [592], the 15 studies [593], [625], [707] summarizes and a further 4 articles [661], [662], [662], [702], [704], [704], [705], [705], [706] also indicate an average mortality rate. In the same way, there was a decrease in the frequency of surgery, a decrease in frequency of surgery, an increase in frequency of frequency of surgery, a decrease in the frequency of frequency of frequency of surgery, a decrease in the frequency of surgery of surgery of surgery. a decrease in the period of the period The data on the use of SBRT in operable stage I were evaluated as an alternative to the OBD, but the results of the OBD and the OBD were evaluated as good results. In 2010 the OBD published the retrospective data of 87 patients (stage IA: n = 64; stage IB: n = 23), who were medically qualified for lobectomy, but decided to use SBRT [708]. Cumulative local control was carried out 5 years after SBRT (median BED10: 116 Gy) at 92% for T1-tumors and 73 for T2-tu- moren. The overall survival of the OBD was not 72% and 62% respectively (stage IA or IB). Two attempts were made to investigate the effectiveness of SBRT in prospective-rando- mized studies compared to the lobectomy. In this group, the majority of patients with adeno-ca (79 %) and peripheral localization (67 %) were treated with an SBRT. These results were compared with a surgically treated patient group of the MD Anderson Cancer Center using propensity score matching. In this group, where a VATS lobectomy was performed with a mediastinal lymph node dissection, a 3-year survival of 91% and a 5-year survival of 84% were reported. In the multivariable analysis, no survival differences were observed between the SBRT and the surgically treated cohorts. Despite the limited number of cases, the Reivised STARS trial does not have to be discussed with any other patients who are able to achieve SBRT due to a patient who is willing to perform an operation or who is unable to perform a baseline survey. In some cases, the number of lymph nodes is higher than the number of lymph nodes.

However, a later study showed no differences in survival between patients with an en-bloc full-wall breast wall resection or a less aggressive progression if a complete resection is achieved [693] (evidence level 3b). Regarding the aggressiveness of the surgical procedure, all studies show no significant difference in lethality (evidence level 3b). The radicality of breast wall resection is a significant predictive factor (evi-denz grade 3). The depth of breast wall infiltration may affect the prognosis, where a greater role is played here by surgical technique, which is also recommended only in case of pleurainvasion without rib infiltration.",

This also follows from a subgroup analysis of the IALT study [748]. An analysis of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E3590 and the Italian study of Trodella et al. showed that postoperative radiotherapy with modern technology and narrowly limited target volumes does not lead to an increased risk of late, non-tumour-related deaths. According to data from retrospective and prospective randomized studies on the locoregional effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy, this will not lead to postoperative radiotherapy at stage IIIA, an individually classified local recurrence risk, or after R1/R2 resection in individual cases – using radiation therapeutic methods with as low exposure to the lungs as recommended – neither postoperative radiotherapy nor postoperative radiotherapy will lead to postoperative Iditivity survival after stage II.",

However, the result of this study was a reduction in the number of patients who had been treated with the first randomised phase III (LUNG-ART / EORTC) but who had been treated with the first dose of BSC. In fact, more than 501 patients with N2 disease (completely resected) were randomised to follow adjuvant chemotherapy in a treatment with radiotherapy (54 Gy in 5.5 weeks) versus BSC. Virtually all patients received postoperative chemotherapy, and in almost 40 % the N2 diagnosis was only postoperative and in almost 50% only a lymph node was affected in the mediastinal.

For ECOG 3-4 patients, there are insufficient data on therapy. For some large phase III studies, subgroup analyses of included ECOG-2 patients exist, there are single phase II and III studies and a meta-analysis. In some studies, ECOG-2 patients and older patients (over 65 or over 70 years) are considered together, where there are overlaps, but also differences between these patient groups.

The most recent approval was Cemiplimab, which was superior in NSCLC patients with a dose of ≥50% of chemotherapy. There is currently no recommendation and no authorisation in this case for patients in Stadium III where radiochemotherapy cannot be performed. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 314 Background 8.101 and 8.102 Regarding the duration of system therapy, only the study data are available which are generally available in 4 cycles of combination therapy from Chemo + ICI, followed by maintenance therapy up to progression or non-lerable toxicity. In the combination studies with atezolizumab 4 or 6 cycles of therapy were possible. In Phase III studies varied from ICI to duration of therapy. In clinical studies, however, it is clear that in patients who have been treated with anti-mammary disease (e.g., epileptic disease) or epileptic disease (e.g., epileptic disease). In clinical studies, the clinical benefit may be limited to patients who have received A) all cycles of therapy by protocol, B) who are not more than one year after ICI stop progressed and C) in those patients who have received ICI therapy. However, it is still a major challenge in the individual case to decide when to stop ICI therapy if necessary. Conclusion: in palliative setting, the clinician should be given 4 cycles of chemo-ICI. In clinical studies, maintenance therapy should be followed individually by a continuation of ICI treatment. In clinical studies, however, ICI treatment can then be discontinued in individual cases until the loss of clinical renal disease. The incidence of adverse reactions of CTC grade ≥3 is similar to those of the total population without autoimmune disease [1115], patients with NSCLC [11] had an incidence of adverse reactions [1115]. The incidence of immuno-related adverse reactions was similar to that of HIV patients in general. In addition, two prospective studies showed a good tole- rables safety profile without viral reactivation, as well as good activity in advanced tumours, including the NSCLC [1127]. ICI therapy can hypothetically even increase HIV specific immunity, as the immune system strengthened by immunotherapy can destroy HIV reservoirs that remain in the body despite retroviral therapy [1056]. It is recommended to closely monitor CD4 and CD8 during ICI therapy. Background Non-ICI-based therapies If an ICI-based therapy is out of the question, but the patient is in a normal general state (ECOG 0-1) then a platinum-based chemotherapy or monotherapy is to be offered in individual cases.

Treatment duration In two randomized studies, the time duration of chemotherapy was examined. One study should show a difference in the 6-month survival rate of > 33% and the median survival time (MÜZ) from 4 to 6 months compared with 3 versus 6 cycles of mitomycin/vinblastin/ cisplatin. A difference was not established (MÜZ 6 versus 7 months; p = 0.2); however, in the comparative arm only 31% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy [1129]. In the case of disease progression, a difference in the 1-year survival rate of 15% was observed. The administration of 4 cycles of carboplatin/ paclitaxel versus continued administration of carboplatin/ paclitaxel was not demonstrated for either treatment period. However, in the case of patients who had been treated with the disease, there was no evidence of survival of the disease. In the first study (JMEN) the treatment was improved after 4 cycles of a combination chemothera-pie and in the absence of progress in a pemetrexed or placebo arm. The first dose was increased in the first dose. The first dose was increased in the first dose in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose. The second dose in the second dose.

Once again, no significant survival benefit for cisplatin could be found (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.20; 10 randomized studies, n=2515). Subgroup analyses for gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel also remained without significant survival benefit. Another subgroup (meta) analysis of 6 randomised studies showed a significant survival benefit for carboplatin when low cisplatin doses (40-80 mg/m2) were used in the comparative arm (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.28).",

However, the differences between 6 Stadi ium IV V patients were reported in the first half of the week and the second half of the fourth half of the second half of the first half of the second of The median survival rate in ITT population was 1 to 4 months with Atezolizu mab 13.8 compared with 9.6 months with Docetaxel (HR 0.73, p=0.0003) and 15.7 vs. 10.3 months with Atezolizu mab. Thus, the coprimary endpoints were reached. In the chemotherapy group, 17% of the patients received follow-up immunotherapy, usually with Nivolumab. Another 41% of patients received chemotherapy in the atezolizumab group compared with 31% in the docetaxel group. The PFS was similar to that in the CheckMate 057 study with HR of 0.95 and was nominal 2.8 months with Atezolizumab versus 4.0 months with Docetaxel. The median survival rate was not improved with PD-L1 expression in all subgroups. The most significant improvement was seen in patients with the highest PD-L1 expression (TC/IC3, 16% of ITT, HR 0.41). [1142] Excessive Excessive Excessive Excessive Excessive Non-Excessive Excessive Excessive Excessive Non Non Non In addition to this, there is no longer a need to be informed about some of the major symptoms associated with this type of disease. One of the major clinical events in the EG1 study was: EG1 or EG1; EG2; EG2; EG2; EG2; EG3; EG2; EG2; EG2; EG2; EG; EG; EG2; EG2; EG2; EG; EG2; EG; EG; EG; E In addition, in the case of high-dose monotherapy, the incidence of high-dose monotherapy is not higher than the incidence of high-dose monotherapy. In the case of high-dose monotherapy, the incidence of high-dose monotherapy is higher than in the case of high-dose monotherapy. In the case of high-dose monotherapy, the incidence is higher than in the case of high-dose monotherapy. Excipients were randomised to 2 years of survival (in patients < 70 years of age [661]). In this study, the oral administration of vinorelbin was statistically significantly less related to overall survival and progression-free survival compared to intravenous vinorelbine administration. This was particularly true of the PS2 patients [642]. In the subgroup analysis of a phase III study, evidence of benefits of survival in patients over 70 years of age with nab paclitaxel plus carbopla-tin vs. paclitaxel plus carboplatin was also reported. In the case of EGOG 2, patients were treated with EGOG 2, but more than 50% of the waking time on their legs, outside of bed or armchairs, were treated with EGOG 2, respectively. In the case of EGOG 3, patients were treated with EGOG 2, but in the case of ECOG 2, patients were treated with EGOG 2, respectively. In the case of EGO 3,4 patients were treated with EGOG 2,1086, although there were no data for EGO2 patients. In the case of EGO 3,4 patients with EGO 3,2 patients with EGO 4 with 4 with 4 with 4 In the majority of patients, the incidence rate was higher in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, in the second half of the year. • Bilingham2 patients in PS2 or 0-1 [1154]: A subgroup analysis of PS2 patients in 2 randomised studies with Cis/Ifosfamide (IFO) was not reported in the BP2 population. In the combination therapy patients in PS2 there was a greater improvement in quality of life than in PS 0-1 patients with MIC in the first 6 weeks. Out of 797 patients there were 159 in PS2 patients, the subgroup analysis was not scheduled for Sweeney 2001, ECOG-2 subgroup [1155]: In the ECOG study in 1594, the various platinous combinations were included in the BP2 population (Cis/Pacli vs. Cis/Gem vs. Cis/Doce vs. Carbo/Pacli). One of the more significant differences in the combination group was: In this subgroup of EGFR_FISH positive tumours (n=32) the PFS was significantly prolonged. • ABOUND-PS2 study: In the ABOUND-PS2 study, only chemo-therapy-naive patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included, who had an ECOG2 (n=40) and carboplatin (n=40) were enrolled. In the first half of the year, there was a significant increase in the number of patients who had been treated with EGG2 in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, there was a decrease in the number of patients who had been treated with EG2 in the second half of the year. In the second half of the year, a decrease in the number of patients who had been treated with EG2 in the second half of the year was reported. In the case of combination therapy, it is clear that cisplatin in addition to gemcitabine improved its survival in PS 2. D) Metaanalysis • A metaanalysis of Mörth et al. 2014 [1165], which showed the efficacy and tolerability of a monotherapy or combination first-line therapy in the case of progression NSCLC in PS 2, came to the conclusion that the platinum-containing combination therapy had a significant survival benefit (HR 0.79) in comparison with monotherapy. Two phase II studies (longer, lily tree) are used to treat the disease of the disease (e.g., the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease. Genetic alterations are associated with smoking status, but the sole testing of patients who have never or only lightly smoked (under 10 pack years and more than 15 years of smoking stop) would result in 1/3 of the mutati- ents not being detected [1168]. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with NSCLC should be tested on EGFR receptor mutations regardless of smoking status, including patients with squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of smoking status. Testing on EGFR mutations must be performed prior to initiation of first-line therapy. For recommendations on molecular pathological testing, see Chapter 6.6.10 8.6 Stage IV (without indication for definitive local therapy).",

EGFR T790M, as a \"Liquid biopsy\" (sensitivity ca. 65-70 % in relation to the tissue analysis) should be given to the patient. In case of a lack of feasibility of a tissue biopsy and also in case of suspicion of different resistance mechanisms, a liquid biopsy (NGS analysis of cell-free, circulating tumor DNA) should be performed in order to maximize the patient's potential for further targeted therapies (see chapter 6.6.10 Investigations on molecular target structures). The sensitivity of the liquid biopsy reported a false negative rate of approximately 30-35% in a meta-analysis [1218] will be examined in several original and meta-analyses of the ctNA study with 0.67. In addition, the incidence of T790M in the T790M negative group was 2,8 months [1195].

The IMpower150 regimen was not used as a form of immunotherapy for TKI-pre-treated EGFR+ and ALK+ NSCLC patients. However, the study was not used for one of the patients with an influx of TKI-pre-treated EGFR+ or EMA for 3 years [1042]. One of the three-fold cases of maladministration was reported in the first half of the second half of the third half of the fourth. The first-line dose of ADI in patients with chemotherapy-naïve patients was 1 to 1 months of placebo-indigestion, 1 to 1 to 1 month of placebo-indigestion, 2 months of placebo-indith. The mean duration of response in the CNS was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.8 to 72%) and 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 17.3). The median survival rate was not reached in both patients: Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were reported with Alecti- nib (95% vs. 41% vs. 50 %).

In the course of this study, the patient's survival rate was significantly higher than that of the patient's survival rate. In the case of patients with a history of lung carcinoma, the data can be adapted accordingly. Studies on cost-benefit analyses, which are tailored to the German or Austrian health system, are not yet available at this time, but it can be assumed that similar results are available here. Aftercare with less intensive examination methods versus follow-up care with intensive examination methods Virgo et al. examined retrospectively with different follow-up strategies. In the one group, an intensive routine follow-up with annual appointments were performed. This study was discussed at least in the post-mortem follow-up study. In this prospective analysis, however, it is not clear whether this survival extension in analogy to the screening studies is a lead time bias effect. In the meantime, the results of the randomized IFCT study ([1755]) have been presented internationally, but they are not quite clearly classified. Thus, in the first three to four years due to the structuring imaging follow-up studies there was no difference in the survival data. However, after four post-mortem follow-up/follow-up 484 to five-years there was a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours. These can then be treated again in part a curative manner. For example, for the treatment of brain metastases, there is an urgent need for the treatment of brain metastases in post-care and the importance of outcome survival. However, this point is not recommended in risk situations with LD-SCLC, ED-SCLC, and especially in the question of using PCI or alternatively imaging observation with PCI or stereota xie of metastases.

For example, if the patient's disease is diagnosed with the disease, the benefit of the disease should be assessed with the benefit of the disease. For example, in the case of patients who have been diagnosed with cancer, there is no indication of whether they have been treated with the disease. In the case of patients who have been treated with the disease, there is an increase in the incidence of disease due to age-related chronic diseases in an ageing population. In the case of the most frequent localisations of malignant new formations (intestinal, lung, prostate, mamma), there is an increase in the incidence of new diseases in all the regions. However, at the age of 65, there is an increase in the risk of multimorbidity. This also shows an analysis of the Robert-Koch-Institute from the year 2012. In the case of the age of the disease, only about one in five patients who have been treated with the disease has been diagnosed with the disease. At the age of 65, more than half of all people are affected by the disease. In the case of patients who have been diagnosed with the disease, more than 10 patients who have been diagnosed with the disease. For example, in the case of breast cancer, a study has already shown the advantage of ‘softer' chemotherapy over current chemotherapy [1761]. In a position paper, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, the International Society for Geriatric Oncology and the Alliance for Clinical Studies in Oncology advocate the inclusion of both fit and elderly and fragile patients in cancer studies. Studies specifically for older cancer patients should become mandatory if the standard therapy differs from that in younger patients. Therefore, the experts in the paper recommend smaller studies, possibly without a control group, in order to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of their older and comorbid patients [1762]. As long as there are no corresponding studies and thus no evidence, the ex- perten are forced to make possible adjustments after a reasoned justification in the sense of therapy modifications in favour of their elderly and comorbid patients.",
