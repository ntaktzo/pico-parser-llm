The relative risk of developing lung cancer is in close correlation with some factors including: the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the duration (in years) of the smoking habit and the tar content of cigarettes (2). The relative risk of smokers (considered in full) compared to non-smokers is 14, while that of strong smokers (over 20 cigarettes per day) is 20. For those who stop smoking, the risk is progressively reduced over the next 10-15 years, with a significant advantage in terms of years of life earned for those who stop smoking before the 40 years (3-4). European collaborative studies and met-analysis show for the passive smokers an increase in the risk of women developing a lung cancer of women currently between 20% and 50%, compared with non-smokers (5-6). The growing spread of cigarette smoking among adolescents aged between 14 and 17 is a worrying problem in our country, where there has been a significant increase in the number of cigarettes sold in recent years, where there has been a growing consumption of hand-made cigarettes, which is more widespread in men, young age and regions of South Italy, and have emerged on the market new products, promoted by industry as less harmful alternatives to tobacco smoke, but which actually attract new consumer subjects and make them dependent on nicotine: electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco products and products containing nicotine for oral use. Many working and/or thin products have emerged on the market, promoted by industry as less harmful alternatives to tobacco smoke, but which actually attract new consumer subjects and make them dependent on nicotine: electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco products and products containing nicotine for oral use.

      "text": "Italy was one of the first countries in Europe to adopt in 2005 the new measures of prevention - MPOWER - provided by the programme of control on smoking, promoted by the WHO. These measures, including the ban of smoking in public places, immediately produced a drastic decrease in the percentage of smokers in our country. In 2013 the ban of smoking was extended to schools, beaches and public parks. In 2016, the Italian government then issued a new Law, adopting Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament, which required that at least 65% of the packages of cigarettes sold were accompanied by shock images, which showed the harmful effects of smoking on health, together with a series of other measures aimed at reducing the level of social acceptability of cigarette smoke, especially among the new generations. According to a report of the WHO-FM in 2017 on the programme of smoke control, which the Italy represented in an appropriate way the most commonly-used and occasionally-used consumers of cigarettes, making cigarette smoking more difficult compared to the same situation in 2008. The scientific evidence on the subject remains lacking. A recent systematic review Cochrane analyzed 2 randomised studies (n=662) comparing e-cig vs. nicotine-based e-cig vs. placebo e-cig (without nicotine) in smoking subjects, showing a significant reduction in the Tabagic habit in favour of the use of e-cigs based on nicotine (abstention 9% vs. 4%; relative risk 2.29; CI95% 1.05-4.96 respectively). However, the assessed studies included few patients and used devices no longer available on the market because they exceeded those of the new generation. As regards the tolerability profiles, 14 studies (4 randomized and 10 observational, n=1722) were evaluated, which did not report major adverse events, both in subjects who had exclusive consumption of e-cig, both in those who associated a consumption of traditional cigarettes in the United Kingdom, and therefore, many of these studies were conducted in non-controlled regimens, and with a short follow-up, which did not estimate the long-term tolerability profile of these devices (12). The impossibility of maintaining a blinded randomisation and the limited follow-up of the study reduce, also in this case, the reliability of the results reported (13). As regards cigarettes with tobacco heating, an independent study has shown the same content of nicotine and, although at lower concentrations, the same volatile compounds (catalytic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, carbon dioxide) present in classical cigarettes (14). To date there are no studies showing that the use of such devices reduces the level of addiction to cigarette smoke, nor does the risk of lung cancer compared to classical cigarettes. Recently the Institute of Health has published a Guidelines for the treatment of addiction to tobacco and nicotine, with the aim of formulating recommendations evidence-based to promote the cessation of smoking of traditional cigarette, of heated tobacco products and of the consumption of products containing nicotine (e.g. cigarette or other new and emerging products containing nicotine) in the Italian population, to which reference is made to the specific recommendations of the case to the case at 31-A.C.C.D.D.I.D.I.D.I.D.I.D.D.I.I.D.I.I.D.D.I.I.I.I.D.I.I.I.I.I.I.",

      "text": "The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was the first study to demonstrate how early diagnosis of low-dose TC chest lung cancer (LDCT) in high-risk subjects (55-74 years, smokers or ex-smokers within 15 years of enrollment) results in a 20% reduction in mortality associated with this malignancy, compared with standard chest X-ray (15). A recent sub-analysis of this study has also shown that the benefit is greater in COPD patients with FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7, in which a decrease in mortality was observed by 37% (16). These studies have favoured the introduction of recommendations for the implementation of annual LDCT screening by the Task Force of US Prevention Services (USPSFT) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Recently the USPSFT has updated recommendations on screening of lung cancer with LDCT, in particular extending the age range of subjects to be included, between 50 and 80 years (vs between 55 and 80 years), and reducing the history of smoking in the USPSFT to 20 pakL/LGMPS. An annual screening by TC chest should be recommended in smokers or ex-smokers who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day for more than 25 years or at least 10 cigarettes per day for more than 30 years, or who stopped smoking less than 10 years earlier? RECOMMENDATION: In smokers or ex-smokers who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day for more than 25 years, or at least 10 cigarettes per day for more than 30 years, or who stopped smoking less than 10 years earlier, an annual screening by TC chest should be considered as an option of first choice. Recommendation Force: Strong in favour of Motivations/comments to benefit/damage balance; A recent metanalysis based on data published in the literature combined and analyzed all randomised clinical studies of comparison between lung screening with LDCT compared to no screening (NS) or chest radiography (CXRR) in subjects with history of cigarette smoke, to provide a precise and reliable estimate of benefits and damage associated with LDCT. The aggregate analysis showed that the LDC phase is associated with 1,8950,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,500,50 The analysis of mortality related to lung cancer by sex did not reveal significant differences between men and women (p=0.21; I2=33.6%). Although there is still uncertainty about the precise estimation of the rate of overdiagnosis, this metaanalysis suggested that the benefits associated with screening with LDCT outweigh the damages, in subjects with a history of cigarette smoke, ultimately supporting the systematic implementation of lung cancer screening in Italy and around the world (24). Quality of the tests The quality of the tests was judged MODERATA due to risk of distortion. Overall quality of the tests: MODERATA COI: no conflict declared For the rational, the synthesis of the tests and the details of the recommendation see Appendix 1. At the time of the drafting of the current Guidelines the screening of lung cancer by TC chest is still not approved and/or reimbursed by the National Health System. In order to optimize the diagnostic accuracy of the method and ensure the creation of dedicated diagnostic routes are currently in the course of several specific aspects related to the implementation of screening on the national territory, such as the protocol of acquisition of TC, a low-valumory analysis of the test of the standard of the method and the time to be used by this method. The NELSON study uses, instead, as well as other European studies including MILD, an analysis of the volume of nodules, together with a specific methodology of evaluation of the doubling time. This has resulted in a rate of positive outcomes to screening in the basic round of 2.1% with a high positive predictive value, of 43.5%, which falls within the criteria necessary for the implementation of screening23. Therefore, as regards the measurement and management of lung nodules, almost all European companies suggest volumetric evaluation as the minimum requirement for accurate screening of lung cancer, compared to manual measurements of the diameter. Almost all European screening studies of lung cancer used an annual screening interval. The MILD study compared the annual and biennial screening interval by randomizing participants in one of these groups or in the control group and not highlighting differences between the arms of the annual and biennial screening range of screening ranges. False negatives, although not frequently reported, may constitute between 0.2% and 15% of all lung cancers diagnosed in a screening programme, as demonstrated in some work included in a recent review of the international literature conducted in this area (27). The revision authors argue on the existing disputes about the definition of false negative and the methodology for evaluating the rate of these findings in the studies carried out so far and point out how this aspect will likely become more relevant with the growing development of lung cancer screening in the coming years. At European level, in recent years, several scientific societies have supported the implementation of lung cancer screening through the publication of specific recommendations, including the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), the European Society of Radiology (ESR), the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS), the European Alliance for Personalized Medicine (EAPM), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the Swiss University Hospitals. In addition, a statement of consent for the detection of lung cancer in Poland and a joint recommendation for the screening of lung cancers in the newly established EU-wide planning systems has been published by the EU-wide-wide-wide-wide-wide-wide-wide-discipited countries. In this context, the Italian Screening Lung Network is participating in a wider European multicentre project, 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN (4-iTLR), which has already recruited more than 10,000 subjects at high risk for the development of lung cancers (of which more than 8000 have already performed the first LDCT) and will aim to optimize screening methods, combining the most advanced techniques of radiomic analysis of LDCT with the evaluation of biomarkers for the definition of custom protocols based on individual risk.",

      "text": "The classification is more specific to the diagnosis of lung cancer is the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) updated in 2021. More than 95% of lung cancers are found to be found in the most specific species: squamous carcinoma (CS), adenocarcinoma (ADC), large cell carcinoma (CGC) and small cell carcinoma (microcytoma) (29). In the western countries, the frequency of the ADC is clearly increasing (>50%), while CS and microcytoma are significantly reduced (29). In recent years, the precise serological definition of non-small cell lung carcinomas (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC) has become critical thanks to the development of new therapies related to the histotype (29-32). The diagnosis can be based exclusively on immunohistochemical investigations of conventional morphological (IHC) can be found to be of poor-perfected Hematoxylin-eosin or by means of specific tissue (e. May-Grund-Giemsa) adopted in the cytological preparations, but the immunoistochemical investigations (I. The new WHO classification places particular attention to a rather rare entity, the neuroendocrine large cell carcinoma (Large Cell Neuroendocrine in Carcinoma, LCNEC) which can morphologically simulate a little differentiated NSCLC and which necessarily requires diagnostic differentiation of neuroendocrine by immunohistochemical characterization (Deuroendocrine) (29). Precisely the inappropriate use of immunohistochemical investigations, which can reveal aberrant and focal expression of little specific neuroendocrine markers (e.g. CD56), has shown a significant but often unfounded increase in the incidence of this entity which has consequently produced suboptimal or inadequate therapeutic approaches. Molecular studies have shown that >50% of LCNEC are in very different NSCL realities and in particular to solid pattern (36). Therefore, it is recommended to use a careful integrated evaluation of the neuroendocrine markers for new generation (NGS) and synaptophysin in the correct morphological context. However, it should be noted that the cytological sample set up for strip or on a thin layer offers a higher quality than the cell block, especially in terms of artifacts by fixation and length of nucleic acid fragments. For patients with advanced NSCLC, given the need to evaluate the expression of PD-L1 and the presence of possible transferations of the ALK gene by the use of validated antibodies on samples fixed in formalin and included in paraffin, as well as the possibility of carrying out an IHC screening for alterations of the ROS1 gene, the setting up of a cell-b is a highly recommended option especially where there is not an istol sample (biopsy or surgical resection) (42-44).

In synthesis of the PI3KCA and PTEN gene, the PDGFR amplification and mutation, as well as the DDR2 mutations, could guide the therapeutic choices in the CS70-73 phase, the FGFR1 generation, and the PDGFR mutation, as well as the DDR2 mutations, as well as the DDR2 mutations. In patients in early stage of disease subjected to radical surgical resection, the assessment, by single gene or NGS method, of the molecular alterations to the exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of EGFR, and of the re-arrangements of ALK, and the immunohistochemical assessment (IHC) of the expression of PD-L1 are recommended in clinical practice for the definition of the adjuvant therapeutic strategy (Algorithm 2).

The harmonisation studies suggested that, in addition to the use of clone 22C3 on platform Autostainer Link 48 (DAKO), also the use of the same clone on platform BenchMark XT or ULTRA (Ventana) or clone 263 or 28-8 on platform BenchMark XT or ULTRA (Ventana) can guarantee, after internal validation of the specific protocol, comparable results. In addition, for clone 263 there is now commercially available a CE-IVD-marked diagnostic kit and validated on platform BenchMark XT or ULTRA (Ventana) In relation to the necessity for which the test of PD-L1 is carried out in clinical practice, the only mode of interpretation of the clinically valid result is the application of the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS). This is based on the percentage assessment of the positiveness of the membrane, even when the test of the non-L1 is used in the following clinical trial cells. For the evaluation of molecular biomarkers approved in clinical practice in patients with advanced NSCLC, given the availability of frequently limited material compared to conventional technologies, it is advisable to use NGS which could allow simultaneous analysis of multiple biomarkers. In line with what has recently been suggested by the European Association of Medical Oncology (ESMO), the use of this technology is also indicated in view of the increasing number of emerging predictive molecular biomarkers for which there are effective target therapies available in the context of compassionate use programs/enlarged access and/or clinical trial in Italy (96). Considering the constant growth of the number of predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers, and taking into account the need to identify all specific genetic alterations/access and/or clinical trials in Italy (96). However, such procedures should be conducted in highly specialised centres, as underlined by the latest indications of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (98).",

      "text": "Following the first formulation of a diagnostic suspicion of lung cancer it is essential to accurately reconstruct the clinical history (including Tabagic habit, comorbidity, weight loss, performance status, familiarity for malignancies) and perform an in-depth physical examination of the patient. The diagnostic phase and subsequent clinical staging require the rational use of imaging methods and currently available biopsy techniques. If the suspicion of neoplasm has been placed on the basis of a chest X-ray, the subsequent deepening with imaging methods must include the execution of a CT of the chest, upper abdomen and lower cervical region, so as to verify in the same session the possible involvement of other organs, such as liver, adrenals and supraclavatory adenosis (90-100). The most discussed is the opportunity to include in all patients with signs and symptoms of disease (99-100) since the beginning of the diagnostic TC examination of the cephalus in clinically asymptomatic patient. The dimensions of the neo-formation are closely related to the risk of malignantness, as well as the irregularity of the profile. The density of the mass can be homogeneous or dishomogeneous and varies from solid lesions, to lesions with ground or partially solid glass. The growth over time, if demonstrated, is associated with a high risk of neoplasm. The extension of the examination to the upper abdomen in the same session adds a modest expense and can identify metastases in about 10% of patients. However, the relative frequency of false positives or undetermined results at the TC (due mostly to adrenalal adrenalic adenomas or to liver cysts) sometimes requires a further examination of the TC examination with ultrasound and/or with magnetic resonance (RM) and, if the doubt persists, a histic verification, before excluding from the surgical treatment of otherwise operable patients. The extension of the TC examination with mdc also to the evaluation of the lower abdomen is undoubtedly indicated in the lung cancer with histotype SCLC, as reported in the preferred guidelines for the clinical clinical clinical trial in the clinical treatment in the clinical of the clinical, is indicated in the clinical trial or in the clinical trial of the clinical trial of the clinical trial in the clinical of the clinical with medical, or of the clinical with medical in the clinical of the clinical, with medical, or in the clinical of the clinical in Onc, in Onc, or of the diagnosis of the medical, is also with the medical, in the lower abdomen of the lower abdomen of the lower abdomen, or of the lower abdomen, is known, or of the lower abdomen, is indicated to the lower abdomen, or of the lower abdomen, is indicated, is indicated, is indicated of the lower abdomen, is indicated to the lower abdomen, is indicated in the lower abdomen, and of the clinical, is Moreover, these same guide lines consider optional the MRI of the brain also for patients at the IB stage of EGFR+ adenocarcinoma, in which a recent study of 1712 patients demonstrated a diagnostic rendering of the MRI in the identification of the brain metastases of 6.9% compared to the IA stage (0.5%) As regards the diagnostic accuracy of the TC in the evaluation of lymph nodal involvement, a systematic revision published in 2013, which included more than 7000 patients, reported a sensitivity of 55%, a specificity of the radiological repertoire (102), a positive predictive power of 58% and a negative predictive power of the TC are usually related to the presence of micrometastases in normal size lymph nodes, while the false positives are often caused by ongoing or still recent bronchopneumonic processes and/or by non-plastic lymph nodal pathologies. The small negatives to the TC assessment are usually related to the presence of micrometastases in normal size lymph nodes. The 11-TC with 18F-FDG then allows a more accurate stagement of lung cancer than the TC, thanks mainly to its greater sensitivity in the identification of extrathoracic and bone metastases (106-109). PET-TC is certainly useful in the lymph nodal stagement (N-parameter), but with some cautions (102). In the patient in which the presence of non-bulky positive PET-TC adenopaths is negligible (up to 20% of the cases) (102). In addition, a mutagenic stagement with invasive methods (ecoendoscopy and, if negative, mediastinoscopy) is recommended by the recent ACCP and ESTS/ERS guidelines, also in case of very high-risk lymph nodes, in fact, in the presence of some specific requirements (dimensions of the primitive tumor >3 cm, central tumor, tumor with lymphoidal metastases being less than 10 per centipherical. According to the European Society of Radiology (ESR), there are three reasons for moving from an FTR to an SR: the quality, quantification and accessibility of data. The improvement of quality is essentially linked to the standardisation of the report; in particular, the use of a template in the SR provides a sort of check-list of characteristics and data that must be evaluated by the radiologist and, thanks to this ...structure, the radiological data can be associated to the clinical data in order to arrive at a more precise diagnosis, fundamental requirement for a more accurate personalized treatment. In reference to the accessibility, the radiological report is also a source of data for the research as it allows to extract data in an automatic way, which can be used to validate the relevance of biomarkers of imaging in the clinical context or to elaborate new potential research domains. Therefore, the radiological reference should be structured in the content and in the standardised terminology and should be accessible through standard access mechanisms and protocols, the SR is not yet regularly used in the clinical direction; therefore, the radiological reference should be made in the lack of communication. The implementation of the SR is a complex process, requiring the support of advanced technology that can meet the needs of easy use, interoperability with operators and work organisation.",

The censoral tumors, visible endoscopically or localized in the proximal portion of the bronchial tree, are typed in the majority of cases by bronchoscopic way, with a total diagnostic yield of 90% (114-15).

Non-radical resection is associated with survival beyond that of patients not operated. Surgery is not available to patients who, although with limited lung injury, show signs of advanced disease. This approach, in order to ensure the best level of care to the patient, should be performed in centres of chest surgery with high experience, large volume and case mix. It has been widely demonstrated in literature how the volumes of surgical activity are significantly correlated with a reduction in hospital mortality and post-surgery mortality. Also the survival at 5 years of patients treated in centres with high surgical activity is higher than that of patients treated in centres with low surgical activity (138). It has been clearly described as an exclusive activity of chest surgery and its volume are the main determinants as regards the outcomes of survival of patients in major pulmonary resections: according to the European Guidelines the activity of a chest surgery should include a high number of surgical procedures increased to 150±50 Again, and its volume has been demonstrated in a significant number of patients in the long period. Therefore, in the case of Stadium I, II and some patients selected in Stage IIIA/IIIB (T1-T3, N2 single-station treatment, non-bulky, assessed within multidisciplinary groups), surgical therapy should be proposed and performed exclusively at structures with high volume of activity, by specialized personnel with adequate experience. The criteria of operability include: 1. biological operability (prospective of radicality in relation to the stage); 2. anatomical operability (the least possible volume of resection, capable of obtaining radicality); 3. functional operability (opportunity predicted after a radical surgery, which guarantees a sufficient respiratory function). It is therefore defined: 1. operable: an individual suffering from a resectable disease and supposedly able to tolerate the necessary surgical trauma; 2. resectable: a disease that can be completely removed by means of a surgical intervention; 3. curative: a potentially unable to healize the disease.",

The lobectomy associated with llo-mediastinic linfadenectomy represents the standard surgical approach in lung cancer. The anatomical segmentectomy is acceptable only for patients with non-solid lesions with frosted glass (Ground Glass Opacities, GGO) or for very early stages (Tis or T1a). In fact, the lesions that present at the TAC as GGO often configure the presence of an adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive. The determination of the prognostic profile of these tumors has allowed to hypothesize the efficacy of sublobaric surgical treatments with very high cure rates (143). The lobectomies with reconstructive procedures (sleeve lobectomy) or plastic of the pulmonary artery are always indicated in selected cases and can effectively avoid the fatality of non-distructive view. Robotic surgery has some limitations, including longer preparation times, higher costs, absence of tactile responses, need of dedicated equipment and training of the staff. Question 2. In patients with NSCLC in clinical stage I lobectomy should be performed with mini-invasive or thoracotomy approach? A metanalysis of randomised and unrandomised trial (148) with the aim of assessing the safety and efficacy of the mini-invasive lobectomy showed the absence of statistically significant differences between the mini-invasive and thoracotomic lobectomy in terms of postoperative prolonged aerial losses (p <0,71), arrhythmias (p <0,86), lungitis (p <0,09) and mortality (p <0,49).

In patients with lung cancer NSCLC T1-2N0 inoperable due to medical contra-indications, a higher level of stereotaxic treatment is recommended in the last five years than conventional radiotherapy? In patients who are not operable due to the presence of clinically significant comorbidities, medical contraindications or who refuse surgery, and in particular in elderly patients, a valid alternative to surgery is radiotherapy. In particular, stereotaxic radiotherapy (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy - SBRT or Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy - SABR) allows for better results than conventional radiotherapy. SBRT is characterized by the administration of very high biological doses in one or a few fractions, by high dose gradient techniques, and is able to obtain high disease control rates, in the absence of significant toxicity. A bibliographical study of the literature on Medline and Embase databases has been carried out. After the removal of duplicates and the acquisition of full-text 2 studies have been included (see Table 2. A total of 17,973 patients in 17 studies was included in work (SBRT 7395; RTC 10.578). Compared to conventional radiotherapy, SBRT was associated with a significant increase in overall survival (HR 0.66; CI95% 0.62-0.70; p <0,001), lung tumour-related survival (HR 0.42; CI95% 0.35-0.50; p <0,001) and PFS (HR 0.34; CI95% 0.25-0.48; p <0,001). As regards adverse events, SBRT reported a significantly lower rate of dyspnoea, oesophagitis and actinic lungs of all grades (155). Limits: No randomised studies vs. observation, although currently for equipoise are difficult to propose. Benefit/damage: Favorable for survival benefits and limited toxicity of SBRT.

In order to interpret the difference between overall survival (OS) and tumour-related survival (DSS), the authors themselves confirm the need for prospective data to assess the potential causes of non-cancer-related death. This difference between OS and DSS may be due to residual imbalances in baseline characteristics caused by unmeasured or unselected covariates during propensity score analysis, or to insufficient power to detect a difference in DSS, or even long-term toxicity.

Of the 1100-year-olds obtained from the research strategy and after removal of duplicates, 50 records were recovered in full-text. Of these, 31 were excluded for the following reasons: 7 for lack of comparison, 11 published as abstract, 13 for PICO unfit. Therefore, 19 studies (2 metanalysis, 16 RCT and 1 observational study were included). Pignon et al. in 2008 published the LACE (Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation) metotherapy (Long Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation), which included the individual data of 5 Phase III studies, which randomised patients with NSCLC in stage I-IIIA radically operated to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy vs only observation-based (159). In this metaly analysis there were chemotherapy combinations based on cisplatin for a total of 4 cycles and some studies also allowed the sequential use of adjuvanted radiotherapy. In total 4584 patients were evaluated with a median survival of 5, 0.86 years, and 0.85 years. There are unfortunately no data available on the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on the quality of life of patients. Burdett et al. in 2015 published another meta-analysis conducted on individual data of 8447 patients, included in 26 randomised studies. This met-analysis further confirmed the overall survival advantage in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy compared to surgery alone, with a HR of 0.86 (IC95% 0.81-0,92; p <0,0001), which results in an absolute increase in survival rate at 5 years of 4% (increase from 60% to 64%) (160). Strauss et al. in 2008 published the results of a phase III study, in which 344 patients with radically operated NSCLC at IB stage were randomised to receive the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel vs only observation. After a median follow-up of 74 months, there was no survival difference between the two arms of treatment (HR of 0.83 (IC95% 0.64-1,08; p=0.12) (161) of the same study reported a median-valve study of patients in the mid-valve study of +10 patients in the single-valve of 100 to 0.60 to 0. On the basis of these data, the main international guidelines (163-164) suggest considering adjuvant chemotherapy in the IB stage (VII edition of TNM stage) with tumours of >4 cm, however assessing the risk/benefit ratio of this approach for single patient. As regards the timing of initiation of adjuvant treatment, all randomised studies enrolled patients not more than 8 weeks after surgery. Salazar et al. in 2017 conducted a retrospective observational study of 12,473 patients with I-IIIA stage radically operated NSCLC, showing that adjuvant chemotherapy is effective, compared to surgery alone, even when administered up to 18 weeks after surgery. The authors concluded that for patients whose recovery from surgery is particularly slow, delay the administration of adjuvant performance chemotherapy up to 4 months after surgery did not affect the potential benefit (165).In addition, a significant interaction between patient performance and benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (p=0.01) and survival free from disease (p=0.009) was reported in the clinical trial (15). Even in this study, there was no difference in toxicity (34% of grade 3-5 toxicity in patients <65 years vs 41% in patients >70 years) and the elderly received less chemotherapy. Overall, considering the limits of evidence (in particular the availability of data from studies not dedicated to elderly patients), the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients remains to be defined, although in well selected cases this approach should not be precluded. Data in the population ≥75 years are very small, there being few patients with ≥70 years of age in clinical studies; for this reason, the choice of treatment in this age group should always be taken with extreme caution (167-68). The role of chemotherapy regimens based on carboplatin was evaluated in 3 phase III studies (161, LF) cases of IB stage (T2N0) (161), Ou et al. published the results of a phase III study, in which 150 patients with radically operated NCL 27, in stage IIIA (N2) were randomised to one chemotherapeutic treatment (24,8 with median paclitaxel). The results of a phase III study, in which 420 patients with radically operated NSCLC at stage IA, IB, II or T3N1 (VII-edition TNM) were randomised to surgery alone or surgery followed by chemotherapy based on carboplatin and paclitaxel. After a median follow-up of 51 months, no significant difference was observed in terms of overall survival (HR 1.01; IC95% 0.62-1.65; p=0.97) and disease-free survival (HR 0.96; IC95% 0.75-1,22; p=0.74). However, only 66% of patients who had undergone surgery received adjuvanted chemotherapeutic treatment, for which the study did not have sufficient power to demonstrate significant differences between the two arms (170). The most frequently used combinations as adjuvant therapy in the phase included in the methalysis, including cyslastin and ifosplatin based on a significant interaction with the combination (159-160). At a median follow-up of approximately 4 months, the tolerability of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly better for patients who received the combination of cisplatin + pemetrexed as well as for cisplatin + vinorelbine (95.5%; CI95% 87.5-99.1 vs 75.4%; CI95% 63.1-85.2; p=0.001) (173). At a median follow-up of 39 months, no difference was found between the two chemotherapeutic regimens adiuvating in the secondary objectives of relapse-free survival (0.83: CI95% 0.31-2.17; p=0.71) or overall survival (HR 0.59; CI95% 0.16-2,1; p=0.42) (174). Similarly, a phase III (JIPANG) study, multicentred, conducted in Japan, where 784 patients with NCILC (non-squamosa) armory patients (non-squamosa) had a significant improvement in survival (St. As regards the recommendation on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I, the quality of evidence was assessed moderate, due to the lack of precision (reduced number of patients and large confidence intervals) and the low consistency of results (discordant data between LACE metanalysis [159] and Burdett et al. metanalysis [160]). Regarding the recommendation on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II tumors with dimension >4 cm the quality of the evidence was assessed moderate for the risk of imprecision due to the reduced number of patients and the risk of bias due to the fact that in many studies the results on stage II were obtained from analyses by unplanned subgroups. Similarly, for the recommendation on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens in the elderly patients (70-75 years of age), the quality of evidence was assessed as being moderate for the low-risk of clinical trials and trials.

Of the 292 records obtained from the research strategy and after removal of duplicates, 7 records were recovered in full-text.

The data available to date to assess the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in I-II stages radically operated come from constantly updated metanalyzes, of which the first was published in 1998 (192) and the most recent in 2016 (193). The eligible studies included patients radically operated for NCLC stage I-III (including therefore pN2 patients, whose analysis does not concern this paragraph), subjected or not to adjuvant radiotherapy. Cochrane 2016 metan analysis identified 14 studies, however the individual data of patients were made available only for 11 of these trials (research of the studies updated to July 8, 2016) and the final analysis was conducted on 2343 patients. The analysis of survival free from loco-regional and remote relapse highlights a benefit in favour of surgery alone (HR 1,12 [IC95% 1,01-1,24] and HR 1,13 [IC95% 1,02-1,24] and HR 1,13 [IC95% 1,01-1,24] and HR 1,13 [IC95% 1,02-1,2-1,24] respectively). The most surprising finding is the survival free from loco-regional relapse. As the authors suggest, the number of loco-regional relapses is smaller in patients treated with PORT. However, since the death event is the most representative of the observed events, the final results are largely attributable to survival. This suggests that radiotherapy may reduce relapse events and that the increase in risk of death could be attributable to other mechanisms. Unlike previous methanalysis, where PORT was most harmful in the early stages and in patients with minor lymph nodal involvement, in the latter work, where the analysis of the analysis was conducted after updating of the NTM, this observation loses statistical significance.

In fact, if the treatment of the majority of patients with N1 disease can be assimilated to that of early stages, and the treatment of the majority of patients with N3 disease can be assimilated to that of the multi-C stage, the management of N2 disease is certainly more complex and varied. In this case, in fact, the prognosis is different if the lymph node colonization affects only one lymph node surgery to be resected by a single- station-favorable neo-favorable (R4,5) if more stations are concerned or if the lymphnodal spread is extranodal or In very selected cases, clinical-radiological downstaging obtained with induction therapies (chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy) and documented with cyto-histological examination may allow for a surgical indication, which however must always be shared in the multidisciplinary context. The efficacy of the surgical treatment compared to the radiation therapy treatment in patients in stage IIIA-N2, in response after induction chemotherapy, was evaluated in a study promoted by the EORTC, to better define the best locoregional approach in this setting (204). Surgery did not result in a significant benefit in terms of survival at 5 years compared to radiotherapy. In the ESPATUE study, 161 patients in stage IIIA-N2, after a complex chemotherapeutic induction protocol, were randomised to receive a surgical treatment or a boom of concomitant radio-chemotherapy. Among the 2 groups, however, there were no significant differences in terms of PFS and OS at 5 years, among the major limitations of both studies, the clinical heterogeneity of patients enrolled within the IIIA-N2 stage of treatment, however, did not appear to be found in the different forms of treatment that were found to be affected.",

PORT metanalysis (Post-Operative Radio-Therapy) in 1998, while demonstrating in patients radically reset at stage I-II a negative effect on survival, does not clarify the existence of a clinical benefit in patients at stage III (217).Although some methodological criticisms concerning this metanalysis are justified (inclusion of studies mainly very dated, conducted with different total doses, radiobiologically non-optimistic splitting schemes, use of equipment technically unfit for thoracic irradiation, volumes of treatment and non-compliant radiotherapy planning), to date there is no scientific evidence randomized in favour of an adjuvanted radiotherapy treatment.In any case, treatment on the late-valenceal disease, the treatment of a total dose of the half-life was always considered to be based on the radiotherapy station (1.8- 2 Gy/day), to a target volume of the ilo-mediastinic organs involved by the disease, and the half-life of the use of section was always based on the use of the half-life of section of the use of section of the same and the station of the same was always being studied. The data confirm an advantage in favour of PORT in terms of survival with an absolute benefit at 5 years of •8% (HR 0.73; CI95% 0.58- 0.92; p=0.008), with improved disease-free survival (HR 0.70; CI95% 0.60-0.83; p <0.0001) and loco-regional relapse (HR 0.37; CI95% 0.24-0.58; p <0.0001). Also a metaanalysis published in 2019 confirms how PORT increases survival (HR 0.85; CI95% 0.79-0.92) and disease-free survival (HR 0.57; CI95% 0.38-0.85) in patients with multiple lymph nomadal arm stations involved by the disease, which is not evident for patients with single station N2 involvement (221). Certainly these metanalysis have limitations represented the absence of data on the toxicity and quality of life of the patients, since they have not been conducted on the basis of individual data and have sometimes included studies that did not foresee a PET of stadialysis in the first half-life study at stage III pN2.

Subsequent analyses have documented that for 18% of patients, the volume irradiated was greater than expected and that deviations from the protocol for the coverage of the target, major and minor, were respectively 13% and 32% in the PORT arm, with a statistically significant difference (HR 0.46; IC95% 0.3-0,7). Identification of these prognostic factors and awareness of treatment-related toxicity could lead to a personalised prescription of adjuvant radiotherapy in this patient setting.",

The 20-50% of patients with metastatic NSCLC have oligometastatic disease (OM) at diagnosis, and this percentage is increasing mainly due to advances in imaging diagnostic techniques. It was observed that low-load metastatic disease has a better prognosis and that local ablative treatment (LAT) of the primitive tumor and all metastases, exclusively or in addition to standard systemic treatment, can lead to the control of the long-term disease, reaching overall survival rates at 5 years between 12% and 52% (242-243). The definition of OM disease is much debated in terms of number of lesions and sites involved. In clinical studies there are often used a different cut-off disease on the number of metastases and stages of staging. Numerous Phase II studies (246-249) have shown an improvement in survival and a reduction in the risk of local relapse by the use of local treatments with a radical intent, both on primitive and metastatic sites, in patients diagnosed with oligometastatic NSCLC. Resection of the primitive and oligometastatic sites can be taken into account in patients with good performance status and adequate lung function. Besides the imaging necessary to exclude advanced metastatic disease is recommended an adequate invasive lymph nodal stage therapy (EBUS/Medistinoscopy), since the presence of lymph node metastases is associated with worse prognosis. If traditionally the surgical approach is the most used (in 55% of cases of OM disease), the use of the RT stereotaxic stage (SBRT) is expected to be more extensive in surgery in the last years. The SBRT is a modern technique which, compared to the conventional RT, still allows to deliver higher doses of radiation to smaller cancer targets with high conformation and dose gradients. It is a non-invasive treatment in the clinical trials, which can be carried out in all the main sites of the NCIL, which were still able to provide higher doses of the same.

In patients suffering from NSCLC in the locally advanced or metastatic stage, with uncommon mutations of EGFR (except the insertions of the Medline and Embase 20), a treatment of I line with the tyrosino-kinase inhibitors of EGFR afatinib or osimertinib is recommended (compared to chemotherapy)? A bibliographical research of the literature on the Medline and Embase databases has been carried out. After the removal of the duplicates and the acquisition of full-text has been included 1 study (see Appendix 2: Common Phase of the research and PRISMA Phase of selection of the studies). Afatinib activity was elevated in patients in group 1 (RR 71.1%; median PFS 10.7 months; median OS 19.4 months), while it appeared significantly lower in patients in group 2 (RR 14.3%; median PFS 2.9 months; median OS 14.9 months) and those in group 3 (RR 8.7%; median PFS 2.7 months; median OS 9.2 months). Yang et al. reported clinical outcomes of a retrospective series of patients (n=315) who received afatinib as a tyrosino-kinase inhibitor of I-line (GF) for the treatment of non-small cell pulmonary malignancies with EGFR mutations. Authors observed a clinical benefit, in terms of ORR and TTF, decreasing from combined mutations (ORR 77.1%; median TTF of 14.7 months) / pointiform mutations (G719FR, L861Q, S768I, in combination or less with other mutations, with the exception of T790M or other inserations of the 2088-monthsone median T5 (RR 4 months). They reported the results of the clinical study KCSG-LU15-09 (single arm phase II trials), specifically addressed to patients with non-small cell pulmonary malignancies, with non-common EGFR mutations, with the exception of patients with EGFR inserts, who were not included in the study. Of the 36 evaluable patients, 36 had pointiform EGFR mutations and 22 (61%) received osimertinib as the treatment line. ORR, PFS and OS median cases were 50%, 8.2 months and not reached, respectively, after a median follow-up of 20.6 months (272). Bar et al. reported the clinical outcomes of a retrospective series of patients (n=46) who received osimertinib as a recently typosin kinase inhibitor of I line for the treatment of non-small lung malignancies with non-common EGFR mutations. The authors observed a clinical benefit, in terms of ORR, of 50% (432.8% for G719X; 7-1.4% for L861Q; 33% for the median T790-Fs) of 9.1 months. In this context, with regard specifically to the finding of T790M mutation at baseline, although osimertinib as I line treatment has not been prospectively studied in this setting, its pharmacological profile and activity in pre-treated patients suggest the potential efficacy of this molecule (275). Limits: Risks of performance, detection and crossover bias, non-direct applicability of the results on the question of interest.

As regards the tolerability profile, grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 75% of patients treated with the combination (i.e. with discontinuation rates of 69%) and 54% of patients treated with chemotherapy (with discontinuation rates of 36%) (278). At the time of the publication of these Guidelines, I line of amivantamab + platinum-based chemotherapy was available in Italy in the context of a compassionate use program. In 2017, it was a Phase III open-label, multicentre, randomised open- and multicentre, Phase III study involving 419 patients with advanced, T790M-positive NSCLC-positive, T790M mutation positive NSCLC 419 patients, in progression after 1st line of therapy with first or second generation EGFR chysino-kinase inhibitor of EGFR. The patients included in the study were randomised (2:1) to receive osimertinib (80 mg/die) in continuous mode or chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/mq e.v. g. 1) associated with cisplatin (75 mg/mq e.v. g. 1) or carboplatin (AUC e.v. g. 1) every 3 weeks, up to a maximum of 6 cycles, followed by maintenance pemetrexed. After a median follow-up of 8.3 months, the PFS evaluated by the investigators (primary) was evaluated by the upper-up of the investigators (the primary endpoint was also confirmed by a central revision of the osiper independent arm of osimertinib, and was significantly, compared to be; 2 weeks, 2 weeks). At the same time, the cerebral PFS was in favour of osimertinib (i.e. 11.7 vs 5.6 months; HR 0.32; CI95% 0.15-0.69; p=0.004). Also the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) described an advantage of osimertinib in terms of pre-specified symptoms. Osimertinib was favourable in terms of tolerability, with a lower incidence of grade >3 adverse events compared to chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events with osimertinib were: diarrhoea (41%), rash (34%), visual xerosis (23%) and paronicia (22%). Interstitial pneumonia and prolongation of QTc interval occurred respectively in 4% of patients treated with osimertinib. Overall benefit/damage: The balance between desirable and undesirable effects of the study favors osimertinib, which was responsible for significantly increasing both systemic and cerebral response and survival free from progression, compared with chemotherapy, with a profile of Quality-tolerability (unlikely adverse events of the degree of clearance of the bimertinib was also favored. As an alternative to the T790M mutation of EGFR as the main mechanism of resistance to first and second generation inhibitors, other mechanisms may also be involved in the development of resistance acquired to newly-generation EGFR inhibitors such as osimertinib: amplifications of MET and HER2, secondary mutations charged with EGFR (e.g. C797S), transformation of histotype into pulmonary microcytoma (282). The subsequent anticancer treatment should be modulated on the basis of the biological mechanism responsible for the development of resistance, aware that some treatment options are available only in clinical studies. The emergence of a second driver susceptible to molecular target therapy (e.g. BRAF p.V600E mutation, fusions of ALK, RET, FGFR) may be directed to treatment combined with osimertinib and specific inhibitor, in clinical studies or off-label programmes. In 2016, 171 of the 207 patients with EGFR activating mutation had developed RECIST progression to the treatment of I line with erlo-28 (285) patients. Among these, 78 and 93 had only changed therapy and continued erlotinib beyond progression, respectively. In this second group, compared with a first median PFS RECIST (primary endpoint) of 11 months, a median time of therapy with erlotinib (secondary endpoint) of 14.1 months was documented.Also as a secondary endpoint, in these median LFS patients was estimated to be 33.6 months, compared to 22.5 months of patients who had changed therapy with erlotinib (primary endpoint) was also 27.7 months, the median PFS according to RECIST (secondary endpoint) 16.8 months and the median between the differences of the two (secondary endpoint) 5.1 months.The median time of therapy with erlotinib (primary endpoint) was 26.7 months. The median treatment duration after RECIST progression was estimated at 4.1 and 6.7 months in the studies conducted by Mu et al. and Cortellini et al., respectively (288-289). OS estimates, variable from study to study, were at least numerically positive in favour of the beyond progression strategy compared to the change of treatment and the best outcomes were observed in patients receiving even local therapies. While using only retrospective data, the addition to the specific inhibitor of local therapies (radiotherapy, surgery, interventional radiology techniques) is suggested in the presence of oligoprogression. Both scenarios of beyond progression therapy and local therapies in case of oligoprogression should always be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, with the intent of defining the best treatment for each patient. Once the possibility of molecular treatment, patients whose cancers have been undergoing a change of EGFR-non-improvemental medicinal products are currently used in combination.",

All parameters of overall health/quality of life measurement, evaluated by QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires of the EORTC, were in favour of the brigatinib treatment. Camidge et al. recently reported the final results of study ALTA-1L (307).

The activity and tolerability profile of lorlatinib, third-generation ALK typosin-kinase inhibitor, in the 1st line of treatment of non-small cell lung in advanced stage with ALK re-arrangement were compared with those related to crizotinib in the randomised phase III CROWN study, published by Shaw et al. in 2020 (308). In the study, 296 patients were randomised to receive lorlatinib or crizotinib. The main endpoint of the study was progression-free survival evaluated by independent central blind revision (BICR). Among the secondary objectives were the progression-free survival of the patients evaluated by the investigators, the overall survival, the objective responses, the intracranial response and the tolerability. At a median follow-up of 18.3 months for patients treated with lorlatinib and 14.8 months for those who received crizotinib, this PFs were at a rate of 0.1-0. The median duration of response was not achieved in patients treated with lorlatinib, while it was 11 months in the standard arm. In 30 patients with brain lesions measurable at baseline all parameters related to intracranial activity were markedly in favour of lorlatinib.

Strength of recommendation: CONDITIONAL FOR THE LOLLAtinib for subsequent development, and of its activity and toxicity spectrum in various scenarios of ALK-positive disease (311). Recently, Felip et al. reported an update of Phase II of the study, in which the lollarlatinib dose was at least 100 mg/dieup patients (31 In the coorte therapy, the two hundred and five hundred patients were already exposed. At the last half-century, of the total of 295 patients, adverse events of all grade and grade 3-4 were reported in 95.3% and 48.1% of cases, respectively. Hypercholesterolaemia and hypertridemia of all grade (84.4% and 67.1% respectively) and grade 3-4 (18% in both cases) were the most frequently observed toxicity, followed by oedema and peripheral neuropathies, neurocognitive effects and weight gain. Particular attention should therefore be paid to such drug-specific toxicities. Overall benefit/damage balance: The balance between desirable effects (objective response rates, progression-free survival and overall, duration of response, brain activity) and undesirable (drug-specific adverse events) favours lorlatinib compared to chemotherapy, although there were no comparative studies.

In this group, lupid OS from the time of progression was greater than patients who had changed therapy to progression RECIST (still in was second-generation pre-inhibitors) (medial: 16.4 vs 3.9 months; HR 0.27; CI95% 0.17-0.42; p <0,0001), as well as lupid OS from the beginning of crizotinib (medial: 29.6 vs 10.8 months; HR 0.30; CI95% 0.19-0.46; p <0,0001). In a series reported by Watanabe et al. about the outcomes of 11 patients receiving the crizotinib-alectinib sequence, 6 had maintained the first-generation beyond progression inhibitor for a median duration of 9.4 months from the RECIST progression, without affecting the activity and efficacy of the subsequent alectinib treatment (314). As reported by Chiari et al., the survival after ROIST progression did not differ between 22 patients receiving ceritinib or alectinib after the progression to crizotinib, compared to the 7 patients treated with the first-generation inhibitor to bey patients (315). On the other hand, beyond progression and local therapy strategies for oligoprogressive disease also apply in post-crizotinib settings, although additional molecular target therapies are available, always to be considered among the therapeutic options, especially in the case of brain progression (318). For patients who develop systemic progression and for whom a subsequent treatment line is indicated, platinum chemotherapy remains the recommended option, with particular reference to combinations with pemetrexed, given the particular activity of this drug in ARK-riarranged disease.",

Quesito 22 GRADE. In patients suffering from NSCLC in the locally advanced or metastatic stage with ROS1 re-arrangements, a treatment of I line with crizotinib can be considered as a first choice therapeutic option. Recommendation Force: CONDITIONAL FOR MOtivations/comments to the benefit/danno balance: Crizotinib has been shown to be particularly active in patients with NCIL 1st stage advanced. The most frequently reported adverse events of any degree were: visual disturbances (87%), diarrhoea (45%), nausea (51%), peripheral eemi (47%), constipation (34%), vomiting (38%), elevations of transaminases (36%) and asthenia (21%), but were predominantly grade 1-2 events. Grade 3 adverse events were hypophosphataemia (15%), neutropenia (9%), increase of transaminases (4%) and vomiting (4%). The first extensive retrospective data collection on patients diagnosed with NSCLC ROS1-positive, EUROS1, involved 32 patients confirming prevalence in young patients (middle age 50.5 years), female sex (64.5%) and non-smoking (67.7%). The rate of objective responses was 80%, with a median PFS 9.1 months; no unexpected toxicity was identified (321). Three additional prospective, multicentre phase II study studies with single arm were of ROzotinib, or pre-centred in patients with ROS1 rehabilitation. The recently published studies confirmed the efficacy and good tolerability of crizotinib in this subgroup of patients (324) of the newly published study, Quesito 23 on crizotinib for changes of MET, ALK or ROS1 in patients with solid tumours, a basket trial basket conducted in France. The objective response rate was 47.2% with a better response rate reaching 69.4% (325). There are no direct comparison studies between crizotinib and chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and ROS1 re-arrangement, although some evidence suggests a particular activity of pemetrexed chemotherapy. Currently available data derive predominantly from pre-treated patients with chemotherapy, but the high activity and efficacy demonstrated by crizotinib, along with the favorable COSA toxicity profile, are elements in support of the use of crizotinib in I line I-line chemotherapy chemotherapy. The data currently available are mainly derived from patients pre-treated with chemotherapy chemotherapy, but the high activity and efficacy ratio of crizotinib-totinib, together with the favored low-range studies, are the best-to-test studies for survival, and the best-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-test clinical trials are elements supporting elements supporting to the use of the clinical trials in clinical trials of the following the following the following the clinical-prov-prov-states were: the following the following the clinical trials of the clinical trial of the clinical trials of the following populations with ROS were: ROS. In patients suffering from NSCLC in locally advanced or metastatic stage with ROS1 re-arrangements, a treatment of I line with entrectinib was recommended?Recommendation: In patients suffering from NSCLC in locally advanced or metastatic phase with ROS1 re-arrangements, a treatment of I line with entrectinib was considered as a first-choice therapeutic option.Recommendation strength: CONDITIONAL FOR MOtivazioni/comments to the benefit/damage balance: Four clinical trials (STARTRK-2, ALKA-372/001, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-NG) showed efficacy data with good tolerability profile in favour of entrectinib treatment in patients with ROS1 re-arrangement. Dapprim were reported by Drilon et al., the results of Phase I/II ALKA-372-001 and STARTRK-1 (326) were considered by the most recent patients. The adverse events of grade 3 were weight growth (n=17; 8.1%), ALT rise (n=7; 3.3% and diarrhoea (n=6; 2.9%); 7 patients (3.3%) experienced grade 4 adverse events (hyperuricaemia; hypertriidemia; limbic cephalitis; myocarditis; creatinine elevation). Benefit/damage balance: The risk/benefit ratio is in favour of entrectinib given the best tolerability compared to chemotherapy and the greatest clinical benefit in terms of objective responses and progression-free survival. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged as MOLTO BASSA for the following reasons: the main limits of the studies are the low sample number (improvement of estimates) and the absence of a control arm for prospective studies (disruption risk and indirectness), which, considered to be the heterogeneity of the populations included, were also not comparable to each other. A total of 34 ROS1-positive patients treated with lorlatinib in the phase I/II study had previously received crizotinib. In this group, there was a confirmed response rate of 62% in pre-treated patients and 35% in pre-treated patients with crizotinib, with a median PFS of 21 months in non-treated patients and 8.5 months in pre-treated patients with crizotinib. In the same setting, more than 50% of patients with measurable brain metastases achieved a disease response with lorlatinib (64% in non-treated patients and 50% in pre-treated patients with crizotinib) (330). At the time of drafting these Guidelines, this molecule is not approved or reimbursed in re-arranged ROS1 disease. As reported for EGFR-muted disease and ALK-riarranged, beyond progression and oligoprogressive disease treatment strategies may also represent valid options in patients with ROS1 re-arranged patients.",

In patients with NSCLC to advanced non-squamous histology without activating mutations of EGFR or re-arrangements of ALK, with expression of PD-L1 <50% and with good performance status (0-1), a treatment of I platinum, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab in case of response or disease stability after 4 treatment cycles, is recommended (compared to chemotherapy)? RECOMMENDATION: In patients with NSCLC to advanced stage non-squamosa histology, without activation mutations L/EGFR or re-arrangements of ALK, with expression of PD-L1 <50% and with good status performance (0-1), a treatment of I line of platinum, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab is to be considered as an option of first choice. Allopex was confirmed in favour of the combination arm with pembrolizumab both in terms of primary endpoint ORR (58% vs 33%) and PFS (24.5 vs 9.9 months; HR 0.54; CI95% 0.35-0.83) and OS (34.5 vs 21.1 months; HR 0.71; IC95% 0.45-1.12), despite a 70% crossover from the chemotherapy arm to the combination arm. As regards tolerability, the incidence of severe adverse events was 39% among patients treated with the combination vs 31% in patients treated with chemotherapy (365). The KEYNOTE 189, published by Gandhi et al. in 2018, is a randomised phase III, double-blind study of 616 patients with NCILC metastatic to non-squamosa isthology, without EGFR or combination mutations of ALK and with any level of PD-L1 expression, with status of 0-1, on 1st line of treatment (366). The benefit in terms of OS exception is consistent in all subgroups analysed on the basis of PD-L1 expression levels, including PD-L1 negative (n=190; HR 0.55; CI95% 0.39-0.76) and PD-L1 1-49% (n=186; HR 0.65; CI95% 0.46-0.90). The rate of live patients at 5 years was 19.4% in the chemoimmuno vs 11.3% combination arm in the standard arm with platinum-based chemotherapy. As regards to tolerability, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events in the pembrolizumab arm compared to chemotherapy alone (grades 3-5 52.1% vs 42.1%), and the incidence of immune-related adverse events (qany grade 27.7%, grade 3-5 12.6%) was similar to that observed in the pembrolizumab arm of monotherapy (except Nefrite, which occurred more frequently than in the study of the treatment components, 3-5 12.6%).

RECOMMENDATION: In patients with NSCLC to squamble therapy in advanced stage with PD-L1 expression and with good performance status (0-1), a treatment of I-line based on carboplatin, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab, followed by each phase of maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab. The results of the study included the expressive level of PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥ 1% vs <1%), the non-empty outcome of the following trials (paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel) and the geographical region (Asia vs rest of the world). The design of the study allowed crossover after l-unbinding. Patients with ECOG PS 0-1, with diagnosis of non-pre-treated squamous histotype NSCLC, without symptomatic brain metastases, were eligible for follow-up of 56.9 months. The results of the study with a follow-up of 96.9 months showed a significant increase of the OS arm in the pembrolizumab group (17.2 vs 11.6 months; HR 0.71; CI95% 0.59-0.85), with a rate of living patients at 5 years of 18.4% in the chemoimmuno arm vs 9.4% in the standard chemotherapy arm. PFS was also higher in the arm with pembrolizumab (8 versus 5.1 months; CI95% 0.52-0.74), with a response rate of 62.2% for combination with pembrolizumab compared to 38.

With an updated median follow-up of 30.7 months, median LHS was 15.8 months in the experimental arm compared to 11 months in the control arm, with an HR of 0.72 (IC95% 0.61-0.86). The median PFS was 6.7 months in the experimental arm and 5 months in the control arm, with a HR of 0.68 (IC95% 0.57-0.82). The combination also demonstrated efficacy in the subgroup of patients with brain lesions (371-372). The results presented in 2023, with a 4-year update and a follow-up of 47.9 months, confirmed the benefit in terms of overall survival (OS) with 21% of patients treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab and 2 cycles of live chemotherapy at 4 years, compared to 16% of patients treated with chemotherapy only.

The JMDB study, published by Scagliotti et al. in 2008, is a phase III trial randomized with non- inferiority design, open-label, multicentre, conducted on 1725 patients with NSCLC at stage IIIB (not susceptible to treatment with curative purposes) or IV (384).

      "text": "In the II line of treatment of advanced NSCLC, docetaxel was superior in terms of OS to BSC or other chemotherapy agents such as ifofamide or vinorelbine (393-394). Although pemetrexed was shown to be no less than docetaxel in a randomised phase III study, the frequent use of pemetrexed in the I line or maintenance therapy of non- squamous NSCLC to histology limits its role on second line (395). An additional agent that was shown to be effective in therapy of advanced NSCLC II and III line is erlotinib which, in a randomised phase III study, was shown to be superior in terms of OS, in patients with advanced NSCLC, not selected by mutation of EGFR, and considered to be unfit for chemotherapy (396). However, 2 randomised studies comparing erlotinib to docetaxel in II line in patients with advanced WILD-type for EGFR, the Italian study In patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC stage after an I line of chemotherapy who did not receive immunotherapy, a treatment with nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab is recommended compared to a II line chemotherapy? RECOMMENDATION: In patients with advanced NSCLC stage of IV line of chemotherapy, an immunotherapy with nivolumab, atezolizumab or pembrolizumab (the latter only in the case of PD-L1 ≥1%) should be considered as the first option compared to a II line chemotherapy. Strength of the recommendation: FORTE ADVANT Motivations/comments to benefit/damage: Several randomised phase III studies compared the immunotherapy with chemotherapy in the II line treatment, the role of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was evaluated in the CheckMate 017 studies (both squambrousal histology, independently from PD-L1) and CheckMate 057 (non-squamosa histology, independent of PD-Lzumab, the role of positives in the L. Patients treated with nivolumab obtained an advantage in terms of OS (mediated: 9.2 vs 6 months; HR 0.59; CI95% 0.44-0.71; p <0,001), PFS (mediated: 3.5 vs 2.8 months; HR 0.62; CI95% 0.47-0.81; p <0,001) and RR (20% vs 9%, p=0.008) compared to docetaxel. Nivolumab treatment was weighed by a lower incidence of side effects of any grade (58% vs 86%), grade 3-4 (7% vs 55%) and grade 5 (0% vs 2%), compared to docetaxel. The adverse events selected (as potentially immune etiology) of any degree related to treatment were: hypothyroidism (4% with nivolumab vs 0% with docetaxel), diarrhoea (8% vs 20%), pneumonia (5% vs 0%), increased creatinine (3% vs 2%) and rash (4% vs 6%). In this study, the expression of PD-L1 (using immunohistochemistry with 28-8 °C) was also shown to be non-clinical in the pre-emptive analysis of all pre-emptive values. In 2015, it is a phase III randomised open-label, multicentre trial of 582 patients with 0-1 performance status, with NSCLC-related to non-squamosa histology at stage IIIB, IV or relapses after radiotherapy or surgery, with disease progression during or after at least one previous line of double chemotherapy based on platinum; also previous maintenance therapies with pemetrexed, bevacizumab or erlotinib, and prior therapies with tyrosino kinase inhibitors in case of EGFR mutation or re-arrangements of ALK (401). Patients were randomised to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg e.v. every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/mq e.v. every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was OS (midianaup 12,2 vs 9,4 months; at the time of the interim analysis of pre-pianified patients to 0,8 months; this was a minimum follow-up of 13,2 months) nivolumab was shown to be greater than doce-up in terms of OS (midinaup 12,2 vs 9,4 months; with less than 1,0,0,0,00-cent were those with 1,00,00,00 and 1,00,00,00 and 1,00 and 1,00,00 and 1,00,00 and 1, and 1,00 and 1,00 and 1,00; and 1,00 and 2 months, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 1, and 1, and 1, respectively, and 1, and 1, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 2 months, and 1, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 1, and 1, and 2 months, and 1, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 1, and 1, respectively, respectively; The selected adverse events of any degree related to treatment most frequently observed were: rash (9% for nivolumab vs 3% for docetaxel), pruritus (8% vs 1%), erythema (1% vs 4%), diarrhoea (8% vs 23%), hypothyroidism (7% vs 0%), ALT (3% vs 1%) and AST (3% vs 1%), infusional reactions (3% vs 1%) and pneumonia (3% vs < 1%). Also in this study, the interaction test of PD-L1 (by immunohistochemical expression with antibody 28-8) was evaluated backwardly and, unlike in the study, CheckMate 017 for patients with squamous histology cancer, in CheckMate 057 the interaction test suggested a strong association between PD-L1 expression and efficacy endpoints, observed with all the pre-specified cult-off in the pre-specified expression (≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10%). The good tolerability profile of nivolumab was confirmed (402). The KEYNOTE-010, published by Herbst et al. in 2016, is a Phase II/III randomised open-label, multicentre trial of 1034 patients with performance status of 0-1, with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥1% (centrally evaluated by immunohistochemistry with 22C HR3 antibody, and disease progression after at least 1st line of treatment with platinum-based double chemotherapy (including an appropriate therapy with thyronine- kinase inhibitor for patients with EGFR mutation or ALK re-arrangement) (403). About 30% of the patients included in the study had received 2 or more prior treatment lines. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, both pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or docetaxel 75 mg/mq every 3 weeks. = as as as as The results of this study support the possibility of using archive tissue for the determination of PD-L1 expression, since for patients treated with pembrolizumab there were no significant differences in OS compared to the time of tissue collection. Potential risks of bias in the study are represented by: open-label design (with the absence of masking also by the external data monitoring committee), involvement of the sponsor in the analysis and interpretation of the data and drawing up of the article and lack of significance in PFS on the general population, which was one of the primary endpoints of the study (although PFS may not possibly represent an adequate efficacy endpoint in the studies with Limmunotherapy on II line). In addition, there may be limits of transferability of results in the population with genetic alterations drivers (given the low number of positive patients for EGFR or ALK enrolled in the study) and in patients with intermediate expression of PD-L1 (1-49%), for which no data were reported and in clinical practice were most of patients with candidate Phase III (the least-centred patients in Phase II-L, and 1-lined patients with pembrolicher. The primary endpoints of the study were OS (intention-to-treat, ITT) in the whole population and in the subsets of PD-L1 (as a percentage of tumour cells and immune cells expressing PD-L1: tumor cells TC3 ≥50%, TC2 ≥5% and <50%, TC1 ≥1% and <5%, and TC0 <1%; immune cells infiltrating: CI3 ≥10%, CI2 ≥5% and <10%, CI1 ≥1% and <5%, and IC0 <1%) were centrally analyzed by the Ventana SP142 antibody.

Potential for bias of the study are: open design and involvement of the sponsor in the analysis and interpretation of the data and in the drafting of the article. The study nAK, published by Rittmeyer et al. in 2017, is a phase III randomised open-label, multicentre study of 1225 patients with NSCLC, stage IIIB or IV, previously treated with 1 or 2 chemotherapy lines (of which one or more HR therapy based on platinum derivative, and therapy with tyrosino-kinase inhibitor for patients with EGFR mutation or ALK re-arrangement) and with performance status of 0-1 (406). The patients were randomised to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg e.v.) or docetaxel (75 mg/mq), every 3 weeks. Endpoint co-primary cells of the study were the OS in all population (intention-to-treat, ITT). The benefit of OS in favour of atezolizumab was consistent in all predefined subgroups including patients with squamous disease (n=222; HR 0.73; CI95% 0.54-0.98) and non-squamosa (n=628; HR 0.73; CI95% 0.60-0.89), non-smoking patients (n=156; HR 0.71; CI95% 0.47-1.08) and patients with brain metastases (n=85; HR 0.54; CI95% 0.31-0.94), with the exception of patients with EGFR mutation (HR 1.24; CI95% 0.71-2.18). No significant difference was observed between the two arms in terms of PFS, with the exception of the subgroup of patients with high expression PD-L1 (TC3 or IC3), in which there was an advantage for atezolizumab (HR for PFS 0.63; IC95% 0.43-0.91). In terms of RR there were no significant differences between the two arms in ITT (18% for atezolizumab vs 16% for docetaxel), but in the subgroup of patients with elevated PI-L1-LF, respectively.

In patients suffering from NSCLC to adenocarcinoma histology in the locally advanced or metastatic stage, in progression of disease after an I line of chemotherapy, the association of nintedanib and docetaxel is recommended compared to docetaxel alone? A bibliographical research of the literature on the Medline and Embase databases was carried out.

No difference in effectiveness was identified in the two cohorts of the study: patients progressing within 3 months after the end of the pe-card chemotherapy and patients progressing after 3 months after the end of the I-line chemotherapy. The toxicity was higher for the three-weekly schedule while no difference in quality of life was identified between the two schedules. The study therefore supports the option of using the weekly schedule of docetaxel as best tolerable, while preserving the efficacy of the three-weekly schedule which remains the only one approved and refundable at the time of the guide lines. When the LUME-Lung Phase 1 study was performed in Italy with the Doce-Lung Phase 1 trial, while this treatment was currently represented in Doce-L. Limits: A potential risk of bias for this study is that the hierarchical analysis of the OS was introduced prospectively when the study had already begun and after the primary analysis for PFS had already been carried out, but prior to the closure of the database for the OS; furthermore, the sponsor's staff was involved in the drafting of the protocol, as well as in the analysis and interpretation of the data. A limitation in terms of transferability may be represented by the fact that the age of the population included in the study ( median age 60 years, range 53-67) is lower than that usually observed in the clinical practice in this disease. Benefit/damage balance: Probably in favour of the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel in patients with NSCLC ad histology adenocarcinoma, locally advanced or metastatic, especially for patients with disease in progression within 9 months of initiation of I line therapy.",

As for the use of dualettes containing platinum derivatives, the French Phase III randomised trial IFCT-0501 enrolled 451 elderly patients (70-89 years of age) with advanced NSCLC and performance status of 0-2 (413). vs. patients were randomised to receive carboplatin (AUC 6ev. g. 1 every 4 weeks) + paclitaxel (90 mg/mq e.v. terms 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) or a mono-chemotherapy with vinorelbine or gemcitabine treatment.

One hundred and fifty-five years of exploration within this metanalysis suggested an advantage in OS for combinations containing carboplatin (HR 0.67; CI95% 0.59-0.78) but not for those containing cisplatin (HR 0.91; CI95% 0.77-1.08), compared to mono-chemotherapy. A joint analysis of phase III studies randomized MILES-3 and MILES-4, published by Gridelli et al. in 2018, assessed the addition of cisplatin to a mono-chemotherapy of I line in patients with advanced NSCLC, with age ≥70 years and with performance status of 0-1 (415). In the study MILES-3 were enrolled 299 patients with any histology and were randomised to receive cisplatin/gemcitabine (cisplatin 60 mg/mq e.v. every 3 weeks); in the studyLEv-1, 8 and gemcitabine 1200 mg/mq e.v. The ECOG1599 study was the first study dedicated to patients with performance status 2 (416). It is a phase II study of 103 patients with advanced NSCLC with performance status 2, who were randomised (44-20 to receive treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin AUC 6 g. 1 and paclitaxel 200 mg/mq g. 1 every 3 weeks) or cisplatin/gemcitabine (cisplatin 60 mg/mq g. 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq. 1, 8 every 3 weeks), achieving results that can be superimposed in terms of efficacy in the two arms (RR 25% vs 23%; TTP 4.2 vs 4.8 months; OS 6.2 vs 6.9 months) and with a toxicity profile similar to that historically observed for the patient population with status 0-1 alone, although with lower OS compared to that observed in the chemotherapy studies with population with probably 0-1 performance. A met-analysis of 6 randomised studies, which compared the efficacy and tolerability of duplicity vs. single-cellity patients to be compared to the elderly with the treatment of I line of 2 patients with performance, was shown to the populations with outcomes that were probably 0-1. In view of these limitations and pending the results of prospective dedicated studies, efficacy and tolerability in elderly patients would appear to be comparable to those reported for the entire population included in clinical trials (418-420). A complete geriatric evaluation using specific scales of performance status, comorbidity and Farmac therapy would appear to be equivalent to any therapeutic strategy.",

In all other cases, if the patient's clinical condition permits it, a definitive chemo-radiotherapy treatment at radical doses should be evaluated as a first choice therapeutic option. Questo 40. In patients with limited stage SCLC and in good general conditions, chemo-radiotherapy treatment is recommended? Of the 98 records obtained from the research strategy and after removal of duplicates, 4 records were recovered in full-text and included (3 met-analysis and 1 RCT).

However, the data for these patients with no change in any case would not change the results reported, since approximately 90% of the patients included in the various trials were deceased. The metanalysis of Pignon et al. is the first evidence of the efficacy of the radio-chemotherapeutic treatment in patients with limited stage SCLC. However, it is important to report that the trials differ in the dose and timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, in the antiblastic therapy scheme used, in the choice of the subset of patients treated with radiotherapy (all patients in some trials, those who had complete or partial responses or patients with stable disease in others) and in the possible administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, in the antiblastic therapy scheme used, in the choice of the subset of patients treated with radiotherapy (all patients in some trials, those who had complete or partial or partial responses or patients with stable disease in others) and in the possible administration of pancephalal radiotic radiotherapy et al.

Both half-treatment analyses showed the role of radiant treatment in combination with chemotherapy in the increase of survival, however the optimal combination strategy remains controversial. Several radiotherapy schedules (6 were evaluated in the various trials. Regarding the mode of irradiation, in a randomised clinical study, in which 417 patients with SCLC in a limited stage, accelerated hyperfraction radiotherapy produced a statistically significant improvement in survival at 5 years (26% vs 16%; p=0.=0.04) (425). In both groups, the total dose of chest radiotherapy was 45 Gy: 1.8 Gyyy/day in 25 fractions (5 weeks) in patients with standard fractional, 1.5 Gyy in the majority of patients with standard fractional fractional, 1.5 Gyy in the majority of patients with 30 BID fractions (3 weeks) in hyperfraged patients (3 weeks) in the accelerated day mode. Chest radiotherapy was started at the same time as the first cycle of chemotherapy in both: 1.8, 1.8, and 1 mg/ 1, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 2, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 2 and 2 and 2 g, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 2, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, and 2 and 2 and 2, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively, respectively.

The three-therapy with Cy of Cy and three- were divided were attended the three-therapy with Cy and three weeks were attended the three The study, which was designed at the end of the 1980s, certainly has an important limit in the applicability of the results reported in favour of hyperfractional hyperfractional radiant treatment, in view of the evolution of the radiotherapy techniques, but above all for the radiotherapy dose in the standard arm, lower than those commonly used today, which results in limited local control of disease. However, in the study were obtained overall survival rates at 2 and 5 years of 44% and 23% respectively, thus confirming the effectiveness of the concomitant treatment in this setting. The multicentre phase III study CONVERT recently compared accelerated arm-fraction schemes with a total dose of 45 Gy (1.5 Gy in 30 BID fractions) with a conventional fraction scheme, but with higher total doses (66 Gy), 2 Gy die in 33 fractions, in both cases in association with the chemotherapy group with cisplatin and ethoside, administered for 4-6 cycles (426). The 30-year-old study, designed to demonstrate the superiority of conventional radiotherapy, confirmed the validity of the approach with hyperfractional radiotherapy in this setting, in line with the data reported by the study of Turrisi et al. (425). However, in centres where a regimen with hyperfractional chemo-radiotherapy is not executable or by choice of the patient, a conventional chemo-radiotherapy treatment at high total doses can be considered as a valid therapeutic alternative. Regarding the integration of the two therapeutic modes, several studies evaluated the timing of radiotherapy compared to chemotherapy (early or late administration). The metation of De Ruysscher et al. (427) is of reference in this setting. This review, in which 7 trials were included, of which only 2 did not have selection bias (alcation concealment not well defined), was conducted on aggregate days obtained from the published studies, to assess the possible impact of timing of the beginning of the thoracic radiotherapy on the patients. In the early-treatment mode, a 30-day study was not started in the early-treatment of the early-patient. In addition, since 5 studies as abstract are included in the analysis, sufficient data are not detectable for the assessment of the risk of selection biases and the toxicity of the various treatments used. Benefit/damage balance: In light of the evidence described, concomitant chemo-radiotherapy treatment is the option of choice in patients with SCLC with limited disease, however, adequate selection of candidate patients, who can benefit from this approach through the evaluation of clinical conditions. In the studies examined patients had a predominantly ECOG PS of 0 and 1. Another study also paid attention to the role of comorbidities in influencing l'outcome and tolerability to concomitant chemo-radiotherapy treatment in 157 patients with SCLC with limited stage disease (428). For each patient, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated. No significant differences compared to the KIC in response rates (p=0.20), in overall survival (p=0.09), in the G3-G5 toxicity frequency (p=0.49) in the clinical trial trial were considered to be considered as a clinical limit of treatment (with no clinical treatment at all) and therefore included in the clinical trials in the clinical treatment (p).",

After the removal of the duplicates and the acquisition of full-text 4 studies have been included (see Appendix 2: Research Strategy and PRISMA flow of selection of studies). The incidence of cerebral metastases in the pulmonary microcytoma is extremely high. It is estimated that 10% of the patients present cephalic metastases at diagnosis and that 50-70% can develop them thereafter. In view of this risk, cerebral prophylaxis radiotherapy (PCI) is used as an integral part of the therapeutic strategies. The use of PCI results in a significant reduction of the risk of developing cerebral metastases in a total of 210,00 CI and is currently subject of renewed interest. A recent metalysis published in January 2019 was shown by 7 studies in patients with limited/extended SCLC, randomised to receive PCI, for a total CI, and is the subject of the population of 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8 and 8, 8, 8, 8 and 10, 8 and 8 and 8, 8, 8 and 8 and 10 million patients, respectively. In addition, the subgroup analysis based on the presence or absence of cerebral imaging at the end of the radio-chemotherapy treatment shows that there is no benefit in terms of OS for those patients who performed TC or RMN encephalus after chemo-radio (HR 0.94; CI95% 0.74-1.18; p=0.59), while a significant increase in OS in favour of PCI was confirmed in those patients who had not performed any cerebral radiological examination (HR 0.70; CI95% 0.57-0.85) (429). A prospective randomised comparison study between 25 Gy and 36 Gy demonstrated that the optimal dosage of PCI consists of a total of 25 Gy administered in 10 fractions, showing no therapeutic benefit from the intensification of the radiotherapy dose (430).

In patients with lung cancer at an extended stage, an I-line treatment of carboplatin, ethoposide and atezolizumab, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab, in case of response or disease stability after 4 treatment cycles, is recommended compared to platinum-based chemotherapy? RECOMMENDATION: In patients with lung cancer at an extended stage, a I-line treatment of platinum, ethoposide and atezolizumab, followed by a maintenance therapy with atezolizumab, in case of response or stability of disease after 4 treatment cycles, should be considered as an option of first choice. The median incidence of adverse events, including those of grade 3 and 4 and severe, was overall balanced between the two treatment arms both in the induction and maintenance phase, which was compatible with the data on individual drug toxicity.In particular, grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 56.6% of the patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and 56.1% of those in the placebo group.The outcomes reported by the patient (PRO) and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improved in both groups after the initiation of treatment, but a more relevant and durable HRQoL was reported in patients treated with atezolizumab (436).

The recent update of the study, with a median follow-up of more than 2 years, confirmed a benefit in terms of survival in favour of the chemotherapy-durvalumab arm (12.9 vs 10.5 months), while maintaining a 25% reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0,75; CI95% 0.62-0.91; p=0.0032) and a safety profile consistent with the known adverse events associated with the individual medicinal products.

Patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens benefited from a significant reduction in the risk of death at 6 months and 1 year, reporting an OR of 0.87 (CI95% 0.75-0.98; p=0.03) and 0.80 (CI95% 0.69-0.93; p=0.002), respectively, a higher probability of survival and higher response rates. Cisplatin treatment does not increase the risk of toxicity-related death. Sub-analysis was carried out in 9 studies (1579 patients), to assess the possible effect of imbalance resulting from the addition or less of the ethoposis in cysplatin-free or cisplatin-free regimens, confirming the reduction of the risk of death to 6 months and to 1 year in the group of patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens. A metanalysis for individual data, based on 4 phase studies of progression to cysplatin-containing and non-valvarying studies of cysplatin-containing, was considered to be non-valvarying and non-valimentalous. A more recent evaluation of the efficacy of platinum-based polychemotherapy (both cisplatin and carboplatin) compared to platinum-free regimens was carried out in the 2015 Cochrane metanalysis (443), which analysed survival, response, toxicity and quality of life data reported in 32 studies for a total of 6075 patients. Specific sub-analysis was conducted based on the disease stage. Data on the extended disease were reported in 18 studies; 16 studies were assessed of good quality with a low risk of bias. No statistically significant differences were reported in survival at 6, 12 and 24 months and overall response rate in the whole population treated with or without platinum; instead, comprehensive rates of response were significantly higher with platinum-based chemotherapy, but also an increase in adverse events, particularly nausea, vomiting and thrombocytopenia. Only 4 trials reported the assessment of quality of life, but several methodologies were used in the various studies this endpoint was not included in the analysis. In the analysis conducted in the patients with SCL-standards, this trial with extended disease, as compared to the trial-related regimens, were found to be different, 6 months. From the data of one of the most recent methanalysis conducted on the topic (444), which included 7 randomised studies (2027 patients), there is a better overall survival in patients treated with irinotecan-platin, with irinotecano-fly; the RR and PFS are similar for the two regimens. However, among the studies there is a significant heterogeneity, probably ascribable to the pharmacological differences, related to the frequency of polymorphisms in the different populations and ethnic groups, which affect the function of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of irinotecan and to the various regimens used, which have peculiar pharmacokinetics. The activity of the combination irinotecan-platin was in fact predominantly reported in Asian studies. In particular, the first evidences derived from a small Japanese study (446-447), which reported a significant increase in the median survival (12.8 vs 9.4 months) and the survival at least of the non-lycarycaryngal and non-classic regimens, which were not subsequently confirmed in two large studies conducted in the United States (46-447). Limits: In most of the studies included there are not sufficient data for the complete evaluation of the risk of bias selection. In addition, for a more specific assessment a met analysis of the individual patient data would be the most suitable tool, but it is not always executable. In addition, among the studies there is a significant heterogeneity, probably ascribed to the pharmacological differences, related to the frequency of polymorphisms in the different populations and ethnic groups, which affect the function of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of the irinotecan and to the various regimens used, which have peculiar pharmacokinetics. In a Phase III study the activity of the carboplatin-pemetrexed combination was also evaluated in this setting compared to the carboplatin-etoposide schedule, after the encouraging results of the Phase II study. L'arruolazione was interrupted at 908 of the 1820 patients expected, after an interim analysis planned. In the final analysis the pemetrexed-carboplatin regimen should be less effective in terms of overall survival, clinical survival from progression to clinical trial, and treatment rate of systemic responses (449).",

RECOMMENDATION: In patients suffering from SCLC with extended disease and in response after chemotherapy, pro-typical irradiation of the brain (CPI) can be considered as a first choice therapeutic option. Strength of the recommendation: CONDITIONAL FOR Motivations/comments to benefit/damage balance: Brain prophylaxis radiotherapy in patients with extended disease pulmonary microcytoma is one of the most debated topics at present. In this setting, the historical reference data are those of the 2007 EORTC study (450) in which cerebral prophylaxis radiotherapy in patients with major response to chemotherapy has shown not only a significant reduction of the symptomatic cerebral metastasis with a HR of 0.27, but also a significant survival benefit (i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i. i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i. i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i.i. One of the major observations to the Japanese study is the enrollment, on average, of one patient for each participating center, which calls into question whether or not the observed results can be generalized to all patients. The limited availability of cerebral magnetic resonance resonance and the possible doubts about the translation of Japanese results with much higher survival rates than those typically attainable in Europe can explain why at the time surveillance with MRI should be considered with caution (452). Several meta-analysis has been conducted and published to clarify the controversial role of PCI in the extended disease. In the meta-analysis of Ge et al. of 2018 (453) 14 studies including 1221 patients in the PCI group and 5074 in the control one. The results show an advantage in terms of overall survival (HR 0.57; CI95% 0.47-0.69; p <0,001) and of time to the emergence of cerebral metastases (HR 0.47; IC95% 0.33-0.69; p <0.01). The data available on the quality of the detection rate are 93.7% at baseline, then appear to 9 months. Some studies have shown that consolidation chest radiotherapy is well tolerated, is associated with a reduction in the rate of symptomatic local relapses and in some cases may lead to an increase in survival (454-455). CREST study randomised patients in response after systemic treatment between observation and chest radiotherapy at moderate doses and demonstrated an increase in both survival at 2 years and progression-free survival at 6 months, although the primary objective was survival at 1 year, which did not significantly improve Quesito 46. In patients suffering from SCLC in progression to 1st line of chemotherapy, treatment with topotecan is recommended compared to observation alone and other therapies? Out of 84 records obtained from the research strategy and after removal of duplicates, 9 records were recovered in full-text. Of these, 5 were excluded for the following reasons: 2 abstract, 3 no outcomes of interest. Four studies were included. Although the data was not statistically significant, the study resulted in a percentage of objective responses of 24.3% (IC95% 16,2-32,4) versus 18.3% (IC95% 10,8-25,7) in the topotecan vs CAV comparison (p=0,285). Also the differences observed in median time to progression (13,3 vs 12,3 weeks, respectively; p=0,552) and overall survival (25,77% vs 24,7 weeks, respectively; p=0,795), were not statistically significant. Regarding treatment-related toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent with the CAV scheme, while grade 3-4 was greater in the topotecan arm (neutropenia 37.8% vs 51,4% (p <0,001); grade 4 neutropenia 9.8% vs 1.4% (p <0,001); anemia 17,7% versus 7,2% (p to <0,001).

In recent years, a large number of studies carried out in cancer patients in the metastatic phase have shown the usefulness of systematically associating the palliative care with anticancer therapies, followed by the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between 2006 and 2009 (463). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the addition, to standard cancer care, of a program of early palliative care for patients with new diagnosis of advanced pallium. The patients assigned to the control arm without normal oncology, while the patients assigned to the experimental arm were subject, in addition, to a life-loaded Palliative care program for patients with a new diagnosis of advanced palliative therapy, were assigned to the control arm without normal oncology. Although the primary objective of the study is to change the quality of life, the authors also collected information on the vital state of the patients, reporting the best overall survival (11.6 months compared to 8.9 months; p=0.02) in the group of patients assigned to the systematic visits of palliative care. This better survival was not due, emphasize the authors, to intensive care at the end of life, since the percentage of patients receiving cures was actually lower in the experimental arm (33% compared to 54%). The results of the American study are very interesting with regard to the impact of the addition of palliative care and early palliative care, for the whole natural history of the advanced disease (from diagnosis to death), and not only to the failure of the active anticancer therapies, can have a positive impact on the quality of life and on the mood of the patients. This is the result of the improvement of the treatment of the most active treatments in the last years, the improvement of the cures, the improvement of an integrated approach to the death, and not only to the failure of active anticancer therapies, and the patient's. For years now, the AIOM has established a Work Table dedicated to simultaneous care and continuity of care in Oncology. As the document produced following the first National Conference of Consensus on Simultaneous Care, held in Rome in September 2013 at the same time_in_Oncology.pdf] The simultaneous care can only be realized through a review of the current organisational and socio-assistant models, and require a close synergy between the territorial services and hospital activities dedicated to cancer patients. For specific recommendations refer to the specific AIOM Guidelines dedicated to palliative care in oncology.",

X It is estimated that the BRAF gene is mutated in 4% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NCLCs). 50% of these patients have the V600E mutation. The mutations of BRAFs, considered as the alternative oncogenic drivers in the NCLC, lead to . I do not know an activation of the cell signaling routes downstream of the MAP kinases and are generally mutually exclusive compared to the mutations of EGFR and to the re-arrangements of ALK and ROS1 and, contrary to these, are more frequent in the smokers. (1) The prognostic value of BRAF V600E in patients with NCIC remains somewhat clear. (2) As determined by AIFA, Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is indicated for the treatment of pre-treated adult patients with advanced stage positive non-small cell lung cancer at BRAF V600 mutation The role of dabrafenib-trametinib combination remains, however, to be assessed as the first line of treatment in patients with NSCLC and BRAF V600 mutation. expected siderabile?

      "text": "Since 2016 the recommendations made in the AIOM Guidelines have been produced by adapting the GRADE methodology (Material Methodological 2015-2019, to the Italian context. With the GRADE method, complex and costly in terms of time and commitment for Methodologists and for the members of the Working Groups of each LG, only diagnostic/therapeutic clinical questions are addressed for the moment concerning: ✓ diagnostic tests whose balance between benefits and damages is not to be definitively clarified; ✓ drugs/treatments of recent marketing whose balance between benefits and damages is not to be definitively clarified; ✓ medicinal products/treatments historical if new data on efficacy and/or safety have emerged. Common approach to all the LGs remains to formulate the clinical question to which the recommendation will be produced following the P.I.C.O. (P=population; I=intervention; C=confront; O=Outcome) avoiding generic questions (e.g.: what is the role of the XXX intervention in the treatment of ...). Therefore, the question should be asked in this way: P: In patients with (description of the specific characteristics of patient, disease, stage, etc.) I: treatment with (description of the therapeutic intervention subject to the question) C: is susceptible to use as an alternative (description of the treatment otherwise considered as an alternative to the intervention under consideration) The outcomes are listed and described in the text in support of the recommendations: O: with reference to the benefits and damage outcomes (list of the clinical-laboratoristic parameters effect measures, outcome considered essential/important for the therapeutic proposal) • The Working Group (multidisciplinary group) chooses the benefits and damage outcomes by means of a vote on the criticality of the same in the process of formulation of the clinical proposal; • The process of systematic study of the literature takes place without restriction of language or time limit on multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, database area-specifics) and grey literature (trial records, paho, etc.) and will be carried out by a biblimetrical line of the trialology, including the group, the exidentity of the question, but will be kept at least. • The methodological group is competent in assessing the quality of evidence for single outcome , which is based on 5 dimensions (risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias), and is synthesized in 4 levels (high, moderate, low, very low), produces the synoptic tables of evidence and applies the Evidence to Decision Framework (EtD) tool that also takes into account the values and preferences of patients plus a number of other dimensions such as feasibility, equity, etc. • The panel then proceeds to the evaluation of the benefit/damage relationship related to the intervention in question (vote) and, through EtD and discussion, participates in the vote of the recommendation on the clinical question put. Vote which is expressed according to majority. In cases where the majority is not obtained at first instance, the vote will be repeated after further discussion/confrontation with or without new evidence up to a satisfactory level. In case the outcome of the vote consistently shows a clearly divided panel on different positions it is suggested to report the outcome where the recommendation is based on the possible. • In the event that there is no evidence of any rank, the question may be hesitated in a \"good practice statement\" only if the following conditions have been met: − the assessments provided are really necessary in relation to the current health care situation; − the research and the summary of the evidence do not, at this time, constitute an appropriate use of the resources; − after considering all the relevant outcomes and the potential consequences of the recommendations provided, the implementation of these \"good practice statement\" will have a net positive impact on the management of the issue; − there is indirect evidence supporting these recommendations (hereinafter the essential bibliography for critical statements, discussed and re-evaluations shared, reported in the current recommendations) • In addition, at the end of each recommendation the number or full wording of the references supporting it will be reported. • The recommendation for clinical practice expresses the clinical importance of an intervention/process and the strength of the clinical recommendation is graduated on 4 levels (Table 1). Strength of the recommendation Terminology Meaningful Clinical ..In patients with (selection criteria) the intervention under consideration should be the intervention xxx (selection criteria) the intervention under consideration can be considered as the first therapeutic option xxx can be taken as an option of first intention, conditional on consideration as an option aware of the existence of alternative therapeutic favor of first intention, equally proposed (uncertainty regarding alternative to yyycar to the prevalence of benefits on damages) the intervention under consideration should not be ...In patients with (selection criteria) considered as an option of first intervention xxx should not be intended; however, it could be conditional on being taken into account as a suitable alternative to yycar to the use in cases highly adverse therapeutic option of first selected but after complete sharing with intention, as an alternative to yyyxxx the patient (uncertainty as to the prevalence of damage on the benefits) .Nei patients with (selection criteria) the intervention xxx minor should not be considered in case of the intervention under consideration. • Regarding the possibility of considering the use of resources by sustainability threshold (cost-for-benefit analysis) as an outcome (benefit or damage), the GRADE method allows to leave out this option when there is no evidence to support a correct cost-effectiveness analysis (comparison of costs and outcomes of different treatment alternatives) (Guyatt GH, 2008; Brunetti M et al, 2013) Therefore no consideration will be taken of pharmaceutical-therapeutic aspects (applying the EtD will not therefore be evaluated the cost-effectiveness dimension unless evidence of the genre is found in the selection phase of the studies). • They will not be considered in the recommendations and not even in the diagnostic-therapeutic flow charts drugs not yet authorised by AIFA. In the case of drugs in CNN (non-negotiated C band), there will still be explicit information about them in the text. • For some recommendations, formulated from 2012 to 2015, the evaluation of the quality of the evidence has been carried out by the old rules SIN Scottish Interconnectate Guides, where there will be a table of non-need C community.

In these 5 years AIOM has started a deep process of revision - still ongoing - of the way to propose the LGs, which has allowed to obtain important but still perfect results. The effort of these years has in fact allowed to obtain recommendations based on exhaustive reviews of the literature (especially, but not only, for clinical questions addressed with the GRADE method) and with structured and explicit assessments of the quality of the data so as to make transparent the methodological path leading to the strength of the recommendation to the evidence. 5 The vision or preferences of the population is target (patients, doctors, other stakeholders, etc.) included 6 End users (patients, doctors, other √ stakeholders, etc.) of the LG clearly explained 7 Systematic methods for identifying √ available evidence 8 Express criteria for selecting evidence 9 Description of the strengths and √ √ limitations of the body of evidence assessed according to methodological standards (quality of evidence) 10 Clare description of the method for √ formulate the recommendation 11 Benefits and damages considered in the formulation of the recommendation √ 12 explicit links between recommendations and evidence 13 LG reviews to the external experts prior to the update 14 √ study standard √ Ã Ã ̈ ̈ ̈ ̈ Ã ̈ ̈ ̈ ̈ LG) \"AGREE II Comments Expressed in the methodological manual Target population: oncologist (rarely there are different figures) Figures other than oncologist not in all LGs Not in all LGs Target population: oncologist (rarely there are different figures) Explicit bibliographical search Definition of the question (PICO); search strategy on the appropriate engines; evaluation of the selected bibliographical entries; evaluation of methodological quality; summary of the evidences (tables of evidence) only for GRADE questions In the text are listed all the therapeutic options without rightly expressing a ranking of preference Present for some questions (besides the GRADE questions) Through the RIGHT project Available international shows also the good degree of LG ASCO wings, radically changed in the last Table 4.

An indication of this type can only reinforce our approach to the production of recommendations for clinical practice, since the integration between the two systems has always been the proposal of this methodological group. Precisely for this reason, since 2016, AIOM has decided to abandon the evaluation of the evidence according to SIGN to focus on GRADE and to address little at a time all the relevant clinical questions with the latter gradually replacing it to SIGN.

Given that it is put in brackets because it is not always spenable directly in the question, often in fact the outcomes of interest are multiple and it would not be intelligible to insert a list at the end of the question. Example of PIC(O: − In patients with (to name the specific characteristics of disease, stage, or etc.) • treatment with (to describe the therapeutic intervention which is the subject of the question) − can be used as an alternative to (to describe the treatment otherwise considered as an alternative to the intervention under consideration) − (with reference to the specific characteristics of the disease, or damage) (to list the clinical-laborater method intervention parameters, should be used by means of effect, or as an otherwise considered as an alternative to be considered as an alternative to the treatment as an alternative treatment treatment treatment treatment as an alternative to be considered treatment to the treatment as an alternative to be considered as an alternative to the therapeutic proposal))).

Tab. 1: Classification of outcomes 2.2. Selection of literature to support clinical recommendations The MPE research strategy that are called upon to formulate the recommendation should have the best available information available in the scientific literature. To this end, it is necessary to carry out systematic targeted research with the aim of identifying all available studies that have addressed the question. The development of a sensitive, reducible research strategy and that gives manageable results requires figures formed ad hoc, biblimetrists. Once obtained the articles identified by the research strategy the panel must select the best evidences. If there are no systematic revisions of randomised clinical studies (RCTs) relevant the question will be passed on to individual studies or systematic revisions (RS) of observational studies etc., following in summary the known pyramid of evidence. On average, it is relatively easier to identify solid results for outs as useful (all survival studies, it may be considered to be sufficiently progress, and free to find them to be found in the results in the case studies which may be found in the long or to be found. The presence (and traceability) of a research strategy developed specifically for a question or multi-question is a quality element of a recommendation and is required by the international tools (checklists) that measure the validity of a LG. During the process of producing recommendations, a bibliographical search (exhaustive, sensitive and repeatable) of the sources on different medical-scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and area-specific databases) is then carried out. The query of each database follows specific rules for each of them. In PubMed, for example, the keywords are searched first through the MESH dictionary and then in the free search (using the Boolean operator OR to increase sensitivity), using the different tools made available by the database including filters to limit the search (stages of age, type of study design, type of subjects included, etc.) (see Manual on Research Strategies).",

It should be borne in mind that any identified systematic error (bias) would somehow relate to its impact on the result, since not all biases contribute equally to make the results more or less credible/relableable. At the end of the description of the study, in the text and only for the old questions (with SIGN assessment), will remain the level of evidence (1,2,3,4) accompanied by the risk of bias (++,+,-) and indicated if the PICO of the study is sufficiently close/super-low to be found in the study, with bi-verable or distant or distant in relation to the Pico of the question of interest (with the question of interest).

Therefore, each study described and considered relevant for the recommendation has the level of evidence as specified in the text. − the same essential references are reported in the box where the recommendation is presented accompanied by its strength. Important: regardless of the design of the study (indicated by: 1 or 2), if the quality level is negative (-) no recommendation will be produced, even if this was negative (e.g. intervention should not/should not be administered), since by sign (-) is meant to be non-reliable results.

The list of distribution of patients (allocation) to the various 2 RCT- follow-ups of bias-risk studies, the results of which are directly applicable to the population for which the recommendation is produced. 3 RCT without evidence of the transferability of results to the population for which the recommendation is produced. Treatments must be nasted in the list of missing or suitable subjects, and the random method must be produced with bias risks, but with uncertainty regarding the transferability of the results for which is produced. − Selective focus reporting bias. Probability that one outcome is published compared to another due to the fact that the result is positive (statistically significant). Having available the study protocol can serve as a verification. ✓ Precision • evaluates the accuracy of the estimates: − The results are inaccurate when the studies include few patients and/or occur few events thus producing confidence limits of the estimation of the large effect measure which may be compatible with clinical conclusions of opposite sign; − In case the frequency of the event is very low, with large confidence intervals of the relative estimate of effect and close confidence intervals of the absolute estimate of effect, it is possible not to lower the level of quality of the test. ✓ Directness • evaluates the direct applicability of the evidence (P.I.C.O.) − From the population, intervention, control or indirect intervention: the question for which the recommendation refers to a population, intervention, control or otherwise to the extent for which there is evidence of effectiveness in literature is available − Less than to be compared with the intervention, but rather than to the B88 are directly comparable; the question for which refers to the recommendation refers to a population, or to the extent other than those for which are available to the most effective evidence in the literature; −. ✓ Consistency is assessing the consistency of the results between different studies carried out with the same objective: this criterion applies only to the whole of the literature available and not to the single study; it manifests itself as a heterogeneity of the estimates of effect between the studies that does not find logical explanation (diversity in the type of intervention or in the composition of the populations studied) and that therefore increases the uncertainty about the real extent of the effect of the intervention (it applies only in the evaluation of a systematic revision). ▪ Publication bias is an evaluation of the presence of selective publication of the data: tendency according to which the published studies differ systematically from the unpublished studies, which are more likely to report statistically non-significant or negative results. ▪ It is suggested to consider and discuss explicitly this possibility and to examine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is a strong suspicion of this bias decrease or evidence of low quality (the GRADE method is considered to be the very high quality of the trials).",

Adverse events of grade 3 and 4 were only slightly more frequent in the durvalumab arm (29.9% vs 26.1%), as well as adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment (15.4% vs 9.8%) (235). After a median follow-up of 25.2 months, overall survival in the general population was in favour of the durvalumab immunotherapy arm (the median OS was not achieved vs 28.7 months; HR 0.68; CI95% 0.53-0.87; survival rate at 2 years: 66.3% vs 55.6%; p=0.005), as well as the updated PFS-expression levels (HR 0.51; CI95% 0.41- 0.63; p=0.001). Based on this evidence, Durvalumab was first approved by EMA (September 2018) and subsequently by AIFA (determined in December 2018) as consolidation therapy after radical-intentioned chemo-radiotherapy treatment in stage III patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. The 4-year update of the study confirms a clinically relevant and lasting survival benefit in patients treated with Durvalumab with a median OS of 47,5 months, reached for the first time, compared to 29.1 months of the control arm (HR 0.71; CI95% 0.57-0.88) and a PFS of 35.3% vs 19.5%, respectively. The update of survival based on PD-L1 expression levels confirms a significant benefit limited to the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 ≥1%, although the immunohistochemical expression of this biomarker was evaluated only in 63% of patients included in the study (237). In 2022, the update of survival data at 5 years of the study showed 42.9% of the living patients treated with Durvalumab as compared to the three-fold control rate of the arm was not rated at all levels.",

In the Phase II study conducted by Gomez et al. (250), 49 patients suffering from NSCLC with ≤3 metastases in response or with disease stability after at least 3 months of secondary treatment were randomised to be continued with only to be given in the secondary or secondary treatment. The randomised phase II study of Iyengar et al. (251) evaluated 29 patients with non-oncogene-addicted oligometastatic NSCLC (five hundred and forty-five months) at the peak of the first half of the second half of the year of the second half of the third and of the third of the year of the second half of the year of the last was completed of the third and of the last was completed of the third of the second half of the third of the last was The median survival in patients receiving radiotherapy alone was 19.2 months compared to 8.7 months of patients receiving pembrolizumab alone (0.67; CI95% 0.45-0.99; p=0.044). The benefit of radiotherapy was also assessed in patients receiving pembrolizumab alone (0.67; CI95% 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). In these studies, too, radiotherapy did not increase toxicity. The benefit of radiotherapy was also evaluated in patients oncogene-addicted. In Wang et al. (253), 133 patients with EGFR mutation pulmonary adenocarcinoma were randomised to receive TKi (gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib) with or without ablative radiotherapy on primitive cancer and all metastatic lesions (25-40 Gy in 5 fractions based on size and site of lesions). The median follow-up was 23.6 months. The addition of radiotherapy significantly increased not only the survival of aval disease (20.2 to 2.5-months) of metastatic studies on a five-month-long trial of ferocic patients (p0,00 to 5 fractions, but also developed in grade 5 months); and 5.5 months; the median follow-up was 23.6 to be increased not only from disease to 10.5 months.",

At the recent update of the study published by Planchard et al., with a median follow-up of 16.3 months, ORR, PFS and median OS were estimated at 63.9%, 10.8 and 17.3 months, respectively (332), while the rate of live patients 5 years after initiation of dabrafenib and trametinib therapy was 22%. Limits of the study: The collection and analysis of data was performed by the pharmaceutical company. This was a non-arm control study that enlisted a limited number of patients (n=36), since it was a relatively rare molecular subgroup, it is difficult to hypothesize studies of comparison with chemo(immuno) therapy.",

The recent update of the study, with a median follow-up of more than 2 years, confirmed a benefit in terms of survival in favour of the chemotherapy-durvalumab arm (12.9 vs 10.5 months), while maintaining a 25% reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0,75; CI95% 0.62-0.91; p=0.0032) and a safety profile consistent with the known adverse events associated with the individual medicinal products.

At the ESMO 2021 congress, updated data on survival of this follow-up were presented in all patients with updated median survival of this patient population (4 years).
