      "text": "Ballerup 26 August 2022 With Amgen's feedback on the draft assessment report for Sotorasib (Lumykras) second-line treatment of KRASG12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer. We want to highlight the significant innovation Sotorasib brings to patients with incurable non-small cell lung cancer with relapse after prior treatment. An innovation recognised by EMA, who awarded Sotorasib a conditional marketing authorisation due to the significant unmet need addressed by Sotorasib. We are therefore generally satisfied that the studies used reflect Danish clinical practice and that the methods used allow for a health economic evaluation. However, there are issues in this assessment report that Amgen wants to use the opportunity to comment on:",

      "text": "It is unclear why the Medical Council Secretariat has not included a review of undesirable side effects in the assessment of Sotorasib. This is despite the fact that comparative tables of these were prepared and attached to the application material, and that it is possible to include them in the health economic model. In this particular case it is difficult to assess whether adverse events are caused by Sotorasib in Codebreak 100, or whether they are caused by previous treatment lines, which is also commented on in the report. It could have been further clarified if there were also an opinion on undesirable side effects. Sotorasib caused fewer adverse effects of grade 3+ in Codebreak 100 (20.6%) compared to Docetaxel in SELECT-1 (30%) despite the fact that patients in Codebreak 100 were on active treatment for more than twice as long as in SELECT-1, had received several previous treatment lines, and patients in SELECT-1 have better performance scores than the patients in Codebreak 100. We are aware that a comparison of undesirable side effects can introduce a certain side effect, since this is investmentbed true to the same case.",

Therefore, the Medical Council changes the extrapolation of OS for docetaxel to exponential distribution, see the orange curve in Figure 4. This is due to the fact that the exponential distribution has the best statistical fit (see AIC/BIC) of the three distributions (Weibull, Gompertz and exponential) that are considered clinically plausible. The Medical Council also extrapolates the OS for sotorasib with exponential distribution, since there are no clinical arguments that the paralegal distribution of patients should vary between the two treatment arms. • Public Previously in the application, the Medical Council has submitted the following argument based on the Danish lung cancer register: • The experience of the overall patient group of 2015 is considered to be significant in patients with uters.",

In this particular case, Amgen's analysis gives a QALY gain of 0.63 against the Medical Council's 0.52 and an ICER of about DKK 550,000/QALY against the Medical Council's ICER of approximately 839,000 DKK/QALY.

Adjusting for all available variables would have resulted in a small bias, but also in a very low precision, with stochastic uncertainty causing results to be imprecise and accurate. Therefore, the number of variables adjustment for was restricted, keeping the variables that are most likely to remove bias.
