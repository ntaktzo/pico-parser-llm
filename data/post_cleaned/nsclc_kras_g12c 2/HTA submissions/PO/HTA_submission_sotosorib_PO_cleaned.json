Uncertainty of the above results is related to the assumptions on the number of patients and future shares of SOT in the drug market under consideration. It should be noted that the number of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in the B.6 drug programme is increasing and therefore an increase in expenditure may be expected in subsequent years. Evaluations carried out by other HTA agencies indicate uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the medicine and cost-effectiveness estimates, therefore it is necessary to provide the final results of the studies. The guidelines indicate the possibility of using sotorasib in the second line of treatment of patients with NDRP with a KRAS G12C mutation (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2).",

Typical symptoms include reduction of respiratory function or shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a cancer derived from epithelial cells. The most common are 4 types of histology: • glandular cancer (45% - increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancer (DRP) differs from other histological and clinical conditions (high rate of proliferation, short time of tumour doubling; • exceptional tendency to early metastases, chemotherapy and relative sensitivity).",

The analysis of the incidence of adverse events associated with treatment (TEAE), which occurred in ≥ 10% of patients with NDRP with KRAS p.G12C, showed that the use of SOT compared to DOC was associated with: • IS higher risk of diarrhoea (total and ≥3 degree), ALT increased overall and AST increased overall; • IS lower risk of overall fatigue, total alopecia, total anemia, total mouth inflammation, asthenia, total constipation, neutropenia (total and ≥3 degree), and peripheral neuropathy. • IS lower relative risk of adverse events (AE) in ≥ 10% of patients with KRAS p.G12C were reported: • IS greater relative risk: diarrhoea, increased ALT and increased AST; • IS lower relative risk of adverse events (NOS). In general, 23% of patients, the AE associated with treatment discontinuation in 7% of patients, the AE associated with treatment for dose modification in 26% of patients, the AE associated with treatment leading to death in 1% (1 death due to pneumonia) of patients, SAE associated with treatment in 26% of patients. The most common (≥10% of patients) adverse reactions associated with treatment reported in Awad 2022 were diarrhoea, nausea, increase in ALP levels and increase in ALT levels.

      "text": "The economic evaluation, including the estimate of the costs to the health effects obtained The economic evaluation consists of an estimate and compilation of the costs and health effects that can be associated with the use of a new therapy in a single patient instead of therapy already refunded. The cost of therapy is estimated in the currency of our country and the health effects are expressed most frequently in the years of life (LYG, life years gained) or in the years of life lived in full health (QALY, quality adjusted life years) due to the use of therapy. A summary of the values and effects associated with the use of new therapy (and comparing them to the costs and effects of therapy already refunded allows to obtain an answer to the question whether the health effect obtained in a single patient thanks to the new therapy is associated with a higher cost compared to the therapy already refunded. In the alternative, the results of CUA for the comparison of SOT vs DOC, SOT vs NIN+DOC, SOT vs PMX The relative rate of utility (ICUR) from the perspective of the NFZ is: • relative to docetaxel (DOC): • relative to nintedinib in combination with docetaxel (NIN+DOC): • relative to pemetrexed (PMX): According to the applicant's estimates, the relative rate of cost-effectiveness (ICUR) is the threshold of the apparent result of the refund. The summary of costs for the comparison of SOT vs biologic chemotherapy is based on the derivative of platinum (P-CTH) The estimated cost of the analysis is: • from approx. 207,07 zł (the fraction of cisplatin + paclitaxel) to approx. 1 857,18 zł (the relative reason for the analysis of the renality of the medicinal product is equal to approx. If the clinical analysis of the applicant does not contain a randomized clinical study demonstrating the superiority of the medicinal product to the medical technologies previously refunded in the indication, the official selling price of the medicinal product must be calculated in such a way that the cost of using the medicine applied for the refund was not higher than the cost of the medical technology with the most favourable rate of health effects to the cost of obtaining them. In the opinion of the Agency, there are no circumstances of the year of Article 13 of the Refund Act. The assessment of the impact on the health system, including the public payer's budget The assessment of the impact on the health system consists of two essential parts. First, in the analysis of the impact on the budget of the applicant, allows the assessment of potential expenditure related to the financing of the new therapy by public means. The results of the basic analysis indicate that the payment of Lumykras will be made by the public payer's expenses by approximately: • in the first year, • in the second year of the refund. In the option of covering the Lumykras refund, the costs of sotorasib in the option will be around 1st year of the refund and around 2nd year of the refund, and the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the budgetary impact analysis did not include all the indicated comparators for the proposed technology. The estimates were made for docetaxel and the association of nintedanib with docetaxel. The possibility of using Pemetrexed and dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum was omitted. Among the limitations should also indicate the uncertainty regarding the size of the population that would use the proposed treatment and the predicted shares of sotorasib. These values were based on, among others: the opinion of clinical experts. The actual number of patients with p.G12C mutation in KRAS at the current frequency of genetic tests for patients with non-small lung cancers should also be considered to the extent that they are necessary for the use of the public.",

The provision of exclusion of co-occurrence of other cancers is one of the criteria for eligibility for the drug programme under consideration. Discussion of the solutions proposed in the rationalization analysis The subject of rationalization analysis is the identification of a mechanism whose introduction will result in the release of public funds corresponding to at least an increase in costs resulting from a positive decision on the refund of the requested medical technology. A rationalization analysis is submitted if an analysis of the impact on the budget of the entity obliged to finance the benefits of the public refund (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCN 2023 v2); • The European Society for Medicinal Therapy patients has been identified by: • The Polish Society of Clinical Oncology (Polish Society of 2023); • The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2023 v2).
