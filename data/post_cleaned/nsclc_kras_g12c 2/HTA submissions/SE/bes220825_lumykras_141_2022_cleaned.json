      "text": "In the first line of treatment with KRAS G12C, monotherapy is recommended. According to the Swedish National Care Programme for lung cancer (2021-08-25) a combination of immunotherapy and cytostatics and disease progression after this treatment regimen is recommended monotherapy with reach of the cytostatic treatments docetaxel or pemetrexed. The company argued that docetaxel alone is a relevant comparator to Lumykra's monotherapy in adult patients with advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, and in the event of disease progression after this treatment regimen, monotherapy with reach of the chemotherapy regimen is recommended by the majority of patients. The company has reported a health economic analysis comparing Lumykras with docetaxel. The results of the matched indirect comparison determine the rate at which patients progress or die. The effect difference between treatment with Lumykras and docetaxel measured in quality-adjusted years of life (QALY) is weighed against the cost difference in the measure of cost per won QALY. The analysis is conducted from a lifetime perspective, which means that PFS and OS are extrapolated beyond the time horizon of each study. According to the company, clinical experts asked by the company have assessed that the proportion of survivors in the extrapolation of docetaxel is clinically reasonable at year 5 and that a small proportion can also live after 10 years. According to the company t a on a, the same clinical experts estimated that the extrapolations yielding poor results showed for short survival. A Swedish clinical expert asked by the company has, however, indicated that the modeled survival of docetaxel at year 5 and 10 may be excessive in the company's baseline scenario.",

Paragraph 15 of the Prescription Act provides that a prescriptioned medicinal product is to be covered by the benefits and purchase price and the selling price of the medicinal product provided that the costs of the use of the medicinal product, taking into account the provisions of Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Health Care Act (2017:30), appear to be reasonable from medical, humanitarian and social considerations, and 2. there are no other available medicinal products or treatment methods which, according to a balance between the intended effect and the damage effects referred to in Chapter 4, Section 1, Section 1 of the Medicines Act (2015:315), are to be considered as significantly more effective. The preparatory work to the benefit law states that TLV's decision is to be based on three basic principles: the principle of human value - that the care should be given with respect for all people's dignity, the principle of care and the need.",

      "heading": "TLV makes the following assessment:",
      "text": "The TLV values the severity of the disease as being very high when the condition is associated with progression of disease progression, lack of cure and short expected survival. TLV, as well as the company, considers, with the support of the treatment recommendations and TLV's clinical expert, that docetaxel alone is a relevant comparator to Lumykras. Generally speaking, TLV considers that indirect comparisons have a lower evidence value than direct comparative studies because they are associated with greater uncertainties. Despite uncertainties associated with the indirect comparison, TLV estimates based on the existing evidence that sotorasib has an efficacy advantage compared to docetaxel for PFS and OS. TLV has made two changes in the company's health economic analysis and furthermore has made a adopt sensitivity analysis. TLV objects to the efficacy duration assumed by the company. Throughout the entire time horizon (>10 years) the company assumes that there is a treatment effect by assuming that the death rate in each cycle is lower for patients treated with Lumykras than for patients treated with docetaxel. The company assumes that despite the median duration of Lumykra treatment with Lumykra is only about 7 months and less than 3 years treated with the death rate of treatment. With alternative analyses, the cost can be both higher and lower. However, sensitivity analyses do not show significant changes in cost per won QALY. If uncertainty above all points upwards or downwards is difficult to determine. Even taking into account the above-mentioned uncertainties in the analysis, TLV overall assesses that the cost per won QALY for Lumykras compared to docetaxel is in line with the cost per QALY that TLV deems reasonable for the treatment of conditions with very high severity. As studies are ongoing for further indications, TLV finds reasons to limit the subsidy to the current approved indication. Overall, TLV assesses that the criteria in Section 15 of the benefit law are met at the price applied only if the subsidy is subject to limitations and conditions in accordance with Section 11 of the benefit law. Therefore, the application must be granted with the following restrictions and conditions. al da as tt d a See below how to appeal. This decision has been taken by the Medical Benefits Board of TLV. The following members have participated in the decision: former Chief Staffan Bengtsson (Chairman), Chief Doctor Margareta Berglund Rödén, Federal President, Senior Physician Martin Lär.",
