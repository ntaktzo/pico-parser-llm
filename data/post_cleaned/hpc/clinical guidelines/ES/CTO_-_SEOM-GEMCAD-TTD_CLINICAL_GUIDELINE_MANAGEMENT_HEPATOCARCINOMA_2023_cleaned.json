      "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy in the liver and is the third cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC staging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy may also increase survival when surgery is not suitable. In advanced disease, systemic treatment should be offered to patients with ECOG/PS 0-1 and Child–Pugh class A.

Closer follow-up with Diagnosis, pathology, and molecular biology US every three months for 24 months is recommended.
