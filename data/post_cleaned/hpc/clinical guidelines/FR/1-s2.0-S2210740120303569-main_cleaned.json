Method: It is a collaborative work under the auspices of most of the French medical societies involved in the management of HCC. It is based on the previous guidelines published in 2017. Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved. Introduction These guidelines are a collaborative work under the aus- pices of most of French medical societies involved in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim was to develop practical recommendations using only methodologically established evidence-based guidelines or primary evidence, and to achieve an interdisciplinary consensus. A writing multidisciplinary committee (from 8 medical societies), including experts from different special- ties involved in the management of HCC (hepatic surgeon, pathologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and hepatogastroenterologists), reviewed recent literature until May 2020 and wrote a ﬁrst document. which was modi- ﬁed after further interactive discussions. The last version was ﬁnally validated by the steering committee of the participating national societies. The present paper is a summary of the French intergroup guidelines published in March 2019 on the website of the SNFGE society https://www.snfge.org/tncd . Level of evidence was graded according to standard deﬁnition (grade A: large meta analysis or large randomized trial; grade B: small random- ized trials; Grade C prospective non randomized study).When no scientiﬁc evidence was available, recommenda- tions were based on an expert opinion (agreement or not). Epidemiology HCC usually develops in cirrhotic patients (75 to 80% of cases), more rarely on non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease and exceptionally on healthy liver. Prognosis and treatments are conditioned not only by the cancer , but also by the liver function.In France, the incidence of HCC in 2012 was 12.1/100 in men and 2.4/100 in women (InVS report). As in other Western countries, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in incidence of HCC over the past 20 years due to several fac- tors: increasing number of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) related cases, bet- ter diagnosis and management of other complications of cirrhosis.A semestrial abdominal ultrasonography (US) for screen- ing of HCC is recommended in patients with compensated cirrhosis. It enables the diagnosis of HCC at a curable stage in more than 70% of cases and improves overall survival (OS)2 Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology 45 (2021) 101590 in virus-related cirrhotic patients based on the recent results of the French CIRVIR cohort [1]. Diagnosis — Assessment of disease extension Diagnosis Evaluation of non-tumoral liverCirrhosis can be suspected on clinical, biological (prothrom- bin ratio, platelets and albumin), endoscopic (esophageal varices) and morphological criteria (liver dysmorphism and signs of portal hypertension). In the absence of these criteria, a non-tumoral liver biopsy is required to prove cir- rhosis. The value of non-invasive ﬁbrosis tests (Fibrotest®, Fibrometer ®, Hepascore®, Fibroscan®) is not known in the presence of liver tumor.Diagnosis of HCCAfter a craze for non-invasive diagnostic criteria, it is neces- sary to return to a more conventional attitude in oncology, using histological evidence as a reference for the diagnosis of HCC. Indeed, the systematic use of non-invasive criteria exposes to the risk of diagnostic error , especially in case of nodules less than 3 cm [2]. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcino-mas (particularly tumors of 2 to 3.5 cm), may have the same enhancement kinetics as HCC in computed tomography scan (CT-scan) [3] and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [4]. In addition, the absence of pathological diagnosis deeply penalizes research, all the more so as alternatives such as liquid biopsies are not validated. The diagnosis of HCC based on non-invasive criteria is only validated in cirrhotic patients and must be performed by expert radiologists respecting strict technical and interpretive conditions of imaging. If all these conditions are not fulﬁlled, a biopsy is mandatory.Non invasive diagnosis. The characterization of nodules is based on their dynamic radiological behavior. Multiphase CT- scan and MRI with injection of contrast and triple arterial, portal and late acquisitions are the two imaging techniques recommended for non-invasive diagnosis of HCC. HCC radio- logical hallmark is deﬁned by contrast uptake in the arterial phase and washout in the venous/late phase [5]. MRI seems to be superior to CT in terms of sensitivity for the detection and characterization of nodules, particularly to distinguish regeneration nodules from HCC [6]. Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) is the most recent imaging technique developed to characterize vascular behavior of tumors. It has a better sensitivity than CT to detect hypervascularisation at the arterial phase. However , a recent study showed that cholan- giocarcinomas can have the same vascular enhancement and washing dynamics than HCCs in CEUS [7]. Therefore, the role of CEUS is still debated for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC; CT-scan or MRI should be preferred according to European recommendations [5,8] .The standardization of imaging (technique and interpre- tation) is an important issue that led to the creation of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data (LI-RADS) system deﬁning several categories of nodules from benign to HCC [9]. Cri- teria for HCC diagnosis include tumor size, arterial phase enhancement, washout in the portal phase, enhancing cap- sule and threshold growth. It could be useful to improvethe diagnosis of HCC, especially for small nodules. This sys- tem is not yet widely used but should be encouraged to improve standardization of radiological reports and follow- up of patients.There is no place for ﬂuorine-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG PET) in the diagnosis of HCC. Indeed with FDG-PET , hypermetabolism is observed in less than 40% of cases [10] and most of well differentiated HCCs are negative. Another tracer , 11C-choline, could be useful to detect well differentiated tumors. However , the over- all detection rate of PET is inferior to CT-scan and MRI [11].Pathological diagnosis. Biopsy is helpful for the diagnosis of HCC. Indeed, it has been shown that a signiﬁcant num- ber of patients who were transplanted \"for a highly probable HCC of less than 2 cm\" diagnosed with non-invasive criteria, were found to have no tumor on the explant [2]. Moreover , some nodules are diagnosed after histological examination as benign nodules, non-hepatocyte lesions (hemangioma, cholangiocarcinoma) or mixed forms (hepatocholangiocar-cinoma).Biopsy is useful for characterization of tumors in a thera- peutic goal. Indeed, more and more data show that HCCs are very heterogeneous tumors at a pathological and molecular level, leading to deﬁne histological subtypes and molecular classiﬁcations [12,13] .Biopsy using 14 to 18-gauge needles, providing good quality material for histological analysis, should be pre- ferred. It must be performed through a signiﬁcant thickness of non-tumoral parenchyma and with a protection of the parietal path (coaxial needle) to avoid the risk of dis- semination (∼2% ) [14]. It is now accepted that the risks (bleeding and needle track seeding) are uncommon, man- ageable, do not affect the course of the disease and should therefore not be considered as an argument against biopsy.A prospective study evaluated the performance of biopsy for the diagnosis of single nodules less than 2 cm, detected by US. The diagnosis of HCC is conﬁrmed with the ﬁrst biopsy in 70% of cases and, in case of a ﬁrst negative biopsy, the false negative rate is still of 39% with the second biopsy [15]. In practice, a \"negative\" biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis of HCC. In case of negative biopsy of a suspicious nodule, patients should be followed by US and/or CT-scan or MRI every 3 to 6 months. The strategy will be redeﬁned according to the evolution of the nodule; if the size of the nodule increases and remains atypical, a new biopsy is rec- ommended.Diagnostic criteria. Pretreatment investigations Unlike other solid tumors for which therapeutic decision is made according to the TNM classiﬁcation, there is no consen- sual prognostic classiﬁcation for HCC. Many classiﬁcations have been proposed (Okuda, BCLC, CLIP , TNM-AJCC . . .) but studies comparing them yielded discordant results.In practice, treatment of HCC must be discussed in multidisciplinary board; tumor extension, underlying liver function and patient’s general condition should be consid- ered.3 J.F . Blanc, A Debaillon-Vesque, G. Roth et al. Recommendations• Diagnosis of HCC should be based on the pathologicalanalysis of a tumoral and non-tumoral liver fragment (recommendation level: expert agreement).• Elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), even greater than 400ng/mL, is not sufﬁcient to assert the diag- nosis of HCC.Options• The use of non-invasive criteria for diagnosis of HCC in cirrhotic patients is an option (Fig. 1). While one imaging technique (CT-scan or MRI) is required for nodules beyond 1 cm, a more conservative approach with 2 techniques is recommended in suboptimal set- tings.• If the nodule is not typical, a biopsy should be per- formed.• Nodules less than 1 cm should be monitored by US (and/or CT-scan or MRI) every 3 months. If there is no increase in diameter within a 2-year follow-up, the usual periodicity of surveillance can be used again (recommendation level: grade C). Figure 1 Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis algorithm. Assessment of tumor extensionBeyond physical exam and AFP dosing, tumor assessment should include an abdominal MRI combined with a chest CT-scan or a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan, in order to assess tumor morphology (location, number and size of nodules), portal vascularization, and identify pathological lymph nodes or visceral metastasis (lungs, bones, adrenal glands . . .). Brain CT-scan and bone scintigraphy must only be per- formed in case of clinical suspicion of metastasis. Several studies showed that 18-FDG PET CT [16] and 11C-choline PET CT [17] may improve the detection of extrahepatic lesions. A recent publication suggested that 18-FDG PET could modify tumor staging and treatment allocation in patients with HCC [10]. Additionally, uptake on 18F-FDG PET seems to have a potential prognostic value and is associated with poor prog-T able 1 Child-Pugh score.

Therefore, it may facilitate the selection of patients for surgical resection or liver transplan- tation. However , these results have to be conﬁrmed; PET CT has no place currently in clinical practice to assess tumor extension.Evaluation of non-tumoral liver functionThe evaluation of the underlying liver disease should include at least two parameters: the degree of ﬁbrosis and presence of portal hypertension. In case of severe ﬁbrosis (≥F3), clin- ical and biological assessment of liver function is necessary to establish the Child-Pugh (Table 1) and Model for end- stage liver disease (MELD) scores (Table 2). The severity of portal hypertension is screened biologically (platelet count) and endoscopically (hypertensive gastropathy esophageal varices).When a surgical resection is considered, the remaining volume of the liver is evaluated by volumetry. Some teams add \"functional\" tests (indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min), evaluation of the hypertrophy of the future liver remaining after portal vein embolization, or , in the absence of clear endoscopic signs of portal hypertension, a measure of hepatic venous pressure gradient.Evaluation of general condition of patientGeneral condition of patients must be evaluated with the performance status (PS) score (Table 3). Comorbidities and cancers related to the ﬁeld should be checked for , espe- cially in case of alcoholic cirrhosis and/or smoking: heart and respiratory failure, lung and upper digestive tract cancers. Clinical features of metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and its complications (in particular coronary disease) should be seeked because fre- 4 Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology 45 (2021) 101590 T able 3 Performance status (PS) score.

Internationally, the consensual indica- tion for LT is HCC strictly localized to the liver , either single and measuring 2 to 5 cm, or 2 to 3 nodules not exceed- ing 3 cm, in the absence of macrovascular invasion (Milan criteria) [18]. Under these conditions, LT cures two thirds of patients, with results similar to LT for cirrhosis without tumor [19,20] . Retrospective studies have shown 5-year OS rates of 63 to 80% and recurrence rates of 4 to 20% [21]. However , this option suffers from many contraindications (age, physiological state, comorbidities, active alcoholism,T able 4 AFP score.

In practice, LT is discussed in 10% of patients with HCC and is performed in 3 to 4% due to mentioned limitations. Two trends have been observed to optimize the results of LT: the ﬁrst is to encourage resection or percutaneous destruction for single HCCs; the second, on the contrary, is to carefully expand LT indications beyond Milan criteria. In France, this widening of the criteria was not associated with a worse prognosis, the 5-year OS seeming identical to other countries that retained restrictive criteria [22,23] . Consequently, in 2013, the graft attribution crite- ria changed in France, with the adoption of the AFP score by the French Agency of Biomedicine (Table 4). Indeed, it has been shown in a French cohort that in case of a score ≤ 2, results of LT for HCC are excellent [24]. These results were conﬁrmed by a South American [25] and Italian [26] study. In practice, if the score is higher than 2, patient is not eligi- ble for transplantation. If the score is ≤ 2, the patient can be registered on the national waiting list for ‘‘HCC’’ and in case of a single HCC < 2 cm the accessibility to transplant is only based on the MELD score.Due to lengthening of waiting time for LT, reaching 12 to 18 months in 2014 in France, there is a risk of tumor progression, raising the problem of pre-transplant therapies. In practice, most centers perform a waiting treatment (using transarteriel chemoembolization (TACE)) or a \"ﬁrst curative treatment\" (resection or percutaneous ablation). In case of recurrence after a ﬁrst curative treatment with an AFP score ≤ 2, an accelerated access to a salvage transplant is possible under certain conditions.LT with living donors may be considered if the wait- ing period seems excessive, but its place is currently very marginal in France. Down-staging sometimes offers an access to LT in patients with HCC initially beyond crite- ria, even if the place of down-staging in transplant strategy remains to be reﬁned.In summary, LT is part of a global strategy for the mana- gement of HCC. As a result, the choice of performing pre-transplant therapy and the type of treatment should be established in close partnership with the transplant center.Surgical resectionIn cirrhotic patients, resection of HCC should be considered in patients with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh class 5",

The vol- ume of the future remaining liver must exceed 40% of the total hepatic volume. Therefore, when right hepatectomy is considered, prior right portal vein embolization is often required; surgery is performed only if sufﬁcient hypertrophy of the left liver is induced.Under these circumstances, postoperative mortality is < 5%, and 5-year OS and non-recurrence rates approximately 50% and 30%, respectively [19]. Due to improved selection of patients, perioperative management and surgical tech- nique, recent series have reported a 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of 65% or more [28,29] .It is currently admitted that the best candidate for resec- tion has a single nodule less than 5 cm. Yet, good results in terms of survival after resection of larger and/or multiple tumors have been published by expert centers [30,31] . The presence of homolateral tumor-related portal vein exten- sion may be discussed in an expert center for resection when the contralateral main trunk is free from disease [32]. How- ever , French cohorts showed that surgery does not provide OS beneﬁt compared to sorafenib in this setting [33]. Ideally, resection of HCC should consist in an anatomical resection with margins of 2 cm [34,35] .In the absence of advanced liver ﬁbrosis, resection is the gold standard and the possibilities are greater than in cirrhotic patients, even for large tumors [36].Local ablationPercutaneous ablation is an alternative to surgery, usually well tolerated, without signiﬁcant amputation of non- tumoral parenchyma. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most performed techniques and are possible if the tumor is accessible to puncture guided by US or CT and located away from the hilum and large bile ducts. Biliodigestive anastomosis or signiﬁcant ascites are contraindications to local ablation.Local ablation represents an effective alternative to surgery for small HCCs under certain conditions. To date, 6 randomized studies [37—42] and 6 retrospective studies [43—48] with propensity score analysis compared surgery with RFA. Most of these studies have limited statistical power because of the small number of patients. Among the ran- domized studies, only 2 studies were positive in OS and 3 in survival without recurrence in favor of surgery. Of the retrospective studies, two studies were positive for OS in favor of surgery. The majority of studies showed a signiﬁcant lower number of major complications after RFA compared to surgery. Importantly, the two techniques providing quite similar results, for tumors less than 3 cm, the choice of the best approach for the patient must be done according to the size, the location of the tumor and liver function (Table 5) [49].New methods as multipolar RFA and irreversible elec- troporation are being evaluated. The use of multipolar probes may be intended to treat larger tumors, from 3 to 5 cm, but as they do not represent a standard of care, the decision should be based on a multidisciplinary expert board decision, and after considering more appropri- ate options [50,51] . In practice, percutaneous destruction of HCCs larger than 3 cm remains to be evaluated and should be carefully discussed in multidisciplinary meet-ings, with expert interventional radiologists and liver surgeons.Adjuvant treatmentsAfter a curative treatment there is a high risk of recurrence, raising the question of adjuvant therapy. Several trials con- ducted in Asia, mainly in patients with HCC developed on hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, suggest the beneﬁt of adoptive immunotherapy, but this strategy remains difﬁcult to imple- ment [52]. Sorafenib as adjuvant therapy has been tested in several studies with negative results [53]. There is there- fore no evidence of the beneﬁt of adjuvant therapy after a curative treatment of HCC.However , the management of chronic liver disease improves prognosis and may reduce the risk of recurrence. This concerns the treatment of the underlying liver dis- ease (including HCV), management of comorbidities and prevention of complications related to portal hyperten- sion in case of cirrhosis. In 2016, a retrospective cohort study lead to controversy by suggesting an increased risk of HCC recurrence in patients treated with direct act- ing antivirals (DAAs) [54]. In a cohort of 58 patients with a median follow-up of 5.7 months, 16 patients (27.6%) developed a recurrence. Following this publication, many teams reported their experience showing discordant results with methodological limitations. However , the analysis of 3 French cohorts including more than 6000 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, did not ﬁnd an increased risk of HCC recurrence after DAA treatment [55]. These reassuring results have been conﬁrmed by several other large cohorts and meta-analyses [56,57] . In these patients it is therefore recommended to perform a cross-sectional imaging before DAA treatment, since there is currently no robust enough data to determine the role of DAAs on the evolution of HCC.External radiotherapyStereotactic radiotherapy (6 to 20 Gy/session) has been studied in phase I and II studies with good local control rates at 1 and 2 years (between 90 and 100%), high survival rates (80-90% and 70% at 1 and 2 years respectively) and low complication rates [58—60] . This treatment is offered in cer- tain experienced French centers, with adequate equipment. Stereotactic radiotherapy is preferably intended in patients with single or paucinodular HCC not accessible to surgical resection, LT or local ablation. It applies to HCCs less than 5 cm, because beyond there is a signiﬁcant risk of hepatitis radiation.Interesting results have been reported with high-dose focused conformal radiotherapy (≤ 5 Gy / session) in Child- Pugh A patients [61]. High doses of radiation are delivered to the tumor while sparing non tumoral parenchyma. It should only be discussed in patients with single or pauci-nodular HCC less than 5 cm who cannot beneﬁt from other curative options. For larger HCCs (5-10 cm), conformal radiotherapy is possible, but cohort studies and meta-analysis show that it is preferable to associate it with TACE [62].The best indication would be a unique HCC, 4 to 10 cm, not eligible for surgical resection, local ablation or LT. 6 Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology 45 (2021) 101590 T able 5 Criteria for choice between local ablation and resection.

Palliative treatments T ransarterial chemoembolization (T ACE)Two phase III trials and one meta-analysis reported an increased survival (+20% at 2 years) in patients treated with TACE [63]. However the beneﬁt of TACE in HCC remains controversial especially for tumors developed on alcoholic cirrhosis as suggested by the negative results of the FFCD 9402 trial [64]. Two more recent meta-analysis suggest a moderate or very low beneﬁt despite signiﬁcant objective response rates conﬁrmed by pathology [65].TACE was initially recommended in patients Child-Pugh A or B7 [16,41] with multinodular HCC, without vascular inva- sion or extrahepatic spread and in good general condition [27]. However , the most recent recommendations restrain the use of TACE to patients with preserved liver function, Child A without ascites [5]. Segmental portal vein tumor invasion is not an absolute contraindication to TACE but results in this situation are disappointing, without bene- ﬁt compared to sorafenib [66]; such indications should be discussed in multidisciplinary team sessions.Several scores have been developed to better identify good candidates for TACE. None of these scores are clearly validated and consensual. Nonetheless, some criteria are associated with a poor efﬁcacy of TACE as hypovascular and/or inﬁltrative HCC, multinodular bilobar HCCs (more than seven nodules), elevated AFP or increased CRP . In these patients the choice between TACE and systemic therapy must be discussed.TACE modalities including the chemotherapeutic agent, the type of drug carrier using lipiodol emulsion or drug- eluting beads (DEB), the embolization method and the post-treatment monitoring are not consensual. The cur- rent attitude is to encourage selective or supra-selective chemoembolization. A retrospective study suggests that supra-selective embolization is more effective than conven- tional TACE in terms of tumor necrosis in patients waiting for LT [67]. This may be an option for small HCCs when sur- gical or percutaneous treatment is not possible, even if the results remain inferior to local ablation techniques [68]. The selectivity of TACE is important to avoid liver damage; in the recent ESMO recommendations, TACE is restricted to tumors less than 10 cm and accessible to supra-selective catheter- ization [8]. Other TACE modalities using DEB are available with the advantage of a better standardization of the tech-nique. However , despite a better pharmacokinetic systemic proﬁle, the superiority over conventional TACE using lipiodol has not been demonstrated in terms of survival [69]. More- over , DEB induce higher liver toxicity than lipiodol [70,71] . Considering the availability of several effective systemic therapies and the risk of liver deterioration after TACE, the right time to switch from TACE to a systemic treatment is a crucial issue which remains unresolved. TACE failure can be deﬁned by the occurrence of macro-vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, an increase of AFP after TACE, a lack of complete radiological response after two TACE or the occurrence of new lesions less than six months after TACE. There is a scientiﬁc rationale for the association of TACE and antiangiogenic agents. However , association with sorafenib [72] or brivanib [73] failed to show an increase in OS in phase II and III studies and therefore should not be used in clinical practice.Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)This new treatment is deﬁned as the infusion of a radioac- tive substance such as yttrium-90 (Y90) microspheres or similar agents into the hepatic artery. Because of the min- imally embolic effect of Y90, treatment can be safely used in patients with portal vein thrombosis.In the ﬁrst retrospective study comparing TACE and SIRT , ORR was 40 to 50%, time to progression (TTP) 13 months, and OS 20 months [74]. It determined the contraindications (Child-Pugh > B7, hyperbilirubinemia > 35 /H9262mol/L, clinical ascites, digestive shunt that could not be embolized) and the bad indications (major hepatic invasion > 50%, signiﬁcant extrahepatic disease, truncal portal thrombosis).Results from 4 randomized phase III trials have been reported in patients progressive after TACE or not eligible to TACE. The French SARAH trial comparing SIRT to sorafenib included 459 patients [75]. The main objective (improve- ment in OS) was not achieved (8 months with SIRT vs 9.9 months with sorafenib, HR = 1.15, p = 0.18). Similarly, there was no improvement in PFS (4.1 vs 3.7 months). Even if AEs are less frequent with SIRT (76% versus 94%), this negative study does not allow to consider radioembolization as an alternative to sorafenib. In a sub-analysis, the dose of radi- ation delivered to the tumor was associated with prognosis and is important to consider in further trials. The SIRveNIB trial, with a similar design to the SARAH trial, was conducted in Asia [76]. 360 patients were included, 30% with portal7 J.F . Blanc, A Debaillon-Vesque, G. Roth et al. vein thrombosis. OS was not signiﬁcantly increased in the radioembolization group (8.54 vs 10 months), TTP was 5.88 vs 5.36 months (HR 0.93) and PFS was 5.29 vs 5.06 months (HR 0.94). The added value of sorafenib in patients treated with SIRT has been evaluated in the SORAMIC trial compar- ing the association SIRT and sorafenib versus sorafenib alone [77]. The intent to treat population analysis was negative, with a median OS of 12.1 months with the combination com- pared to 11.5 months with sorafenib monotherapy (HR: 1.01; p = 0.93). Finally, the STOP-HCC study is evaluating SIRT prior to sorafenib vs sorafenib alone in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC [78].In view of these negative studies, the place of SIRT in the therapeutic strategy is not yet deﬁned. Despite these negative results, the French authorities approved the use of SIRT with Therasphere®in HCC with portal vein thrombosis, in patients with a good PS, Child-Pugh A and ineligible (or after failure) to sorafenib. This decision is based on ret- rospective data suggesting a beneﬁt of SIRT in HCC with vascular invasion excluding truncular portal invasion [79]. The opportunity to use SIRT in this indication must be dis- cussed in a multidisciplinary meeting, keeping in mind the availability in second line of validated systemic therapies.Medical treatmentsSeveral systemic agents have shown survival beneﬁts in phase III studies carried out in patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score A), in good general condition (PS 0-2), and advanced HCC (BCLC C or B not eligible for TACE). a. First line treatmentsThe efﬁcacy of sorafenib (inhibitor of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-/H9252, CRAF , BRAF , V600E BRAF , c-KIT receptor and FLT- 3) was proven in a phase III randomized study (SHARP trial) comparing sorafenib and placebo in patients with advanced HCC [80]. Despite low response rates, sorafenib showed a signiﬁcant increase in OS (10.7 vs 7.9 months) and TTP (5.5 vs 2.8 months). Most common severe adverse events (AEs) grade ≥ 3 included diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome. Based on these ﬁndings, sorafenib was approved in October 2007 for ‘‘the treatment of HCC\". The consensual indication of sorafenib considered by the French PRODIGE-AFEF working group was \"the palliative treatment of HCC in patients in good general condition (PS 0 to 2), conserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) not eligible for LT, surgical resection, local ablation or TACE), or recurrence after one of these treat- ments\" [81]. A recent phase II study, comparing sorafenib to best supportive care in Child Pugh-B patients conﬁrmed the lack of beneﬁt of sorafenib in patients Child-Pugh B8 or B9 and a weak beneﬁt in Child-Pugh B7 patients [82]. In these patients the decision to use sorafenib should take into account general condition, age and comorbidities to properly assess the risk beneﬁt ratio. Lenvatinib (inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1 to 3, FGF receptors 1 to 4, PDGF /H9251 receptor , RET and KIT) showed comparable efﬁcacy to sorafenib in a non-inferiority phase III study, in patients with BCLC stage B or C (without trun- cular portal invasion) HCC, Child-Pugh A and PS ≤ 1 (OS 13.6 vs 12.3 months) [83]. PFS was signiﬁcantly increased in the lenvatinib arm (7.4 vs 3.7 months; HR 0.66), as well as the objective response rate (ORR) according to modiﬁed RECIST criteria as determined by investigator (24.1% vs 9.2%) andmasked independent imaging review (40.6% vs 12.4%). The most common AEs were hypertension (42%), diarrhea (39%), decreased appetite (34%), weight loss (31%) and fatigue (30%). Lenvatinib was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (but non refunded in France) and is therefore an alternative to sorafenib as ﬁrst-line treatment.The results of the combination of atezolizumab (immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) blocking PD-L1) and bevacizumab (monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF) have very recently been published [84]. In the phase III IMbrave150 study, the association of atezolizumab and bevacizumab signiﬁcantly improved OS and PFS compared to sorafenib in ﬁrst line treatment of advanced HCC; median OS with the combi- nation was not reached vs 13.2 months with sorafenib (HR 0.58). Median PFS was also signiﬁcantly increased (6.8 vs 4.3 months, HR 0.59). Time to deterioration of quality of life was lengthened. In light of these results, this combination is now the reference for the ﬁrst line treatment of advanced HCC. b. Second line treatmentsSeveral phase II and III clinical trials have evaluated the beneﬁt of second-line treatment after failure (or intoler- ance) of sorafenib. To date, three phase III studies are positive in second line.The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded RESORCE trial, showed efﬁcacy of regorafenib (inhibitor of VEGFR1 to 3, c-KIT , TIE-2, PDGFR-b, FGFR-1, RET , RAF-1, BRAF and p38 MAP kinase), at a dose of 160 mg/day three weeks out of four , in patients with Child-Pugh A score, PS 0-1, after failure of sorafenib [85]. Patients intolerant to sorafenib were excluded from the study (the tolerability of prior sorafenib was deﬁned as the administration of ≥ 400 mg daily for at least 20 of the last 28 days of treat- ment). Regorafenib signiﬁcantly increased OS compared to placebo (10.6 vs 7.8 months). The most common AEs were high blood pressure, hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea. The results of the double-blinded randomized CELESTIAL trial comparing cabozantinib (inhibitor of VEGFR 1 to 3, MET , AXL, KIT and RET) to placebo in second or third-line treatment were published in July 2018 [86]. Patients in good condition (PS 0-1), with preserved liver function (Child- Pugh A) after failure or intolerance to prior sorafenib were included. The median OS was 10.2 months with cabozan- tinib versus 8 months with placebo (HR 0.76). Median PFS was doubled, reaching 5.2 months with cabozantinib com- pared to 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.44). Cabozantinib was approved by EMA in November 2018 and is therefore a new option in second- or third-line setting. Ramucirumab is a human antibody inhibiting the acti- vation of VEGF-2 receptor , tested in second line treatment of HCC in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (REACH trial) [87]. Although median OS was not signiﬁcantly increased compared to placebo (9.2 vs 7.6 months), a ben- eﬁt was observed in the pre-deﬁned subgroup of patients with AFP > 400 ng/ml. The results of a second phase III study (REACH-2) speciﬁcally dedicated to patients with AFP > 400 were reported; ramucirumab signiﬁcantly improved OS (8.5 vs 7.3 months; HR 0.710) and PFS. [88]. Additionally, the safety proﬁle of ramucirumab appears more favorable than tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and the time to clinical deterioration is signiﬁcantly delayed in patient receiving ramucirumab [89]. Ramucirumab is approved by EMA and FDA for the treatment of advanced HCC previously treated 8",

Encouraging results in phase I and II studies were published for nivolumab and pembrolizumab with interesting ORR of respectively 20% and 17% [90,91] . However , in phase III trials, both nivolumab and pembrolizumab failed to demonstrate a sig- niﬁcant improvement in OS and PFS as single agents in ﬁrst and second line, respectively [92,93] .The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients who progressed on frontline therapy was evaluated in the phase I/II CheckMate-040 study; ORR was 31% [94]. An accelerated FDA approval was granted to the combination in March 2020 for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Frontline international phase III trials of anti-PD1/PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 combina- tion versus sorafenib are underway (nivolumab/ipilimumab (CheckMate 9DW); durvalumab/tremelimumab (HIMALAYA study)).For the moment, no CPI is approved in second line in Europe for the treatment of advanced HCC.Other ﬁrst line phase III trials combining anti- PD1/PDL1 and anti-angiogenic agents are ongoing (atezolizumab/cabozantinib (COSMIC trial), pem- brolizumab/lenvatinib (LEAP-002 trial)). Results should be available in 2021. Therapeutic indications: recommendations,options HCC developed on cirrhotic liverTreatment strategy is guided by tumor extension, Child-Pugh score, and presence of portal hypertension; it is summarized in Fig. 2. Three situations are schematically possible: - For HCC without vascular or extrahepatic extension, with an AFP score ≤ 2 and/or in the Milan criteria, a curative treatment should be considered. The choice of treatment is inﬂuenced by the Child-Pugh score and general condi- tions of patients.- For HCC with macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extra- hepatic spread, palliative treatment should be considered and discussed according to the Child-Pugh score and PS status.- In other cases, in patients Child-Pugh A, the curative or palliative option may not be obvious and requires a multidisciplinary discussion in order to beneﬁt from the expertise of teams of transplantation, and interventional radiology (recommendation level: expert agreement). For example, patients with multinodular HCCs beyond crite- ria of transplantation could beneﬁt from a down-staging strategy. The respective place of TACE and systemic treat- ments should also be discussed for every patient in order to allow an optimal use of all therapeutic lines.HCC accessible to curative treatment. It concerns HCCs that are potentially eligible for LT (at diagnosis or after down staging), deﬁned by AFP score ≤ 2.a. Child-Pugh A cirrhosis Recommendations:• Liver transplantation should systematically be discussed, in the absence of obvious contraindica- tions (recommendation level: B). Contraindicationsinclude age over 70, extrahepatic spread including lymph nodes, severe extra-hepatic disease, macro- scopic vascular extension. On waiting list, a bridging treatment can be proposed according to tumoral characteristics and expected time to transplantation (recommendation level: grade C).• Resection or percutaneous ablation should be con- sidered in ﬁrst intention, either in a transplant project at the time of recurrence (salvage trans- plantation) or in case of contraindication to liver transplantation (recommendation level: grade B, Fig. 2).• In case of contraindication to resection or per- cutaneous destruction, hyperselective TACE or stereotactic radiotherapy should be discussed (rec- ommendation level: expert opinion).b. Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis Recommendations:• LT is the reference for severe cirrhosis and should be discussed with a referral center (recommendation level: grade C).• In case of contraindication to LT, reference is RFA for patients Child-Pugh ≤ B7 in the absence of signiﬁcantascites (recommendation level: grade C).• Otherwise, palliative care is the only option.• When an etiological treatment is possible (alcohol withdrawal, treatment of viral hepatitis B or C...), liver function can improve and therapeutic discus- sion regarding HCC reevaluated.Advanced HCC. a.

Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis 10 Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology 45 (2021) 101590 Recommendations:• In the absence of vascular or extrahepatic exten- sion: T ACE (recommendation level: grade A). The size, the number and the localization of HCC should be taken into account and supra selective TACE should be preferred. Liver function after TACE has to be carefully checked.• In case of extrahepatic metastasis, abnormalities of the portal ﬂow , or failure of T ACE, in patients in good general condition (PS ≤ 2): systemic therapy ( Fig. 3)o In ﬁrst-line:/squaresolid Atezolizumab / bevacizumab (recommenda- tion level: grade A)/squaresolid If contraindication to atezolizumab or beva- cizumab• Sorafenib (recommendation level: grade A)• Lenvatinib (recommendation level: grade A)o In second-line:/squaresolid After atezolizumab / bevacizumab• Sorafenib or lenvatinib (recommendationlevel: low)/squaresolid After sorafenib or lenvatinib• Regorafenib in patients previously tolerantto sorafenib (recommendation level: grade A after sorafenib, low after lenvatinib)• Cabozantinib (recommendation level: grade A after sorafenib, low after lenvatinib)• Ramucirumab (recommendation level: grade A after sorafenib, low after lenvatinib)o In third-line:/squaresolid After atezolizumab — bevacizumab and then sorafenib or lenvatinib :• Cabozantinib or regorafenib (recommenda- tion level: low)Options:• In the absence of signiﬁcant extrahepatic disease: SIRT (recommendation level: expert agreement) Recommendation:• Best supportive care (recommendation level: grade C).HCC without cirrhosis Recommendations:• Surgical resection (recommendation level: grade C). Histology of the non-tumoral liver is essential and must be available at the time of the discussion in multidisciplinary meeting. The results of resection are good when there is no portal invasion.• If a resection is not possible: discussion of other treatments according to the same criteria as when there is cirrhosis (recommendation level: expert agreement). Surveillance There is no data available in literature to recommend an optimal surveillance schedule; MRI is the best imaging tech- nique (because non-irradiating) for liver monitoring. When MRI is not available, an injected CT must be performed. Chest CT is the modality of choice to monitor lungs. Radi- ologists must use RECIST 1.1 or modiﬁed RECIST criteria for evaluation of loco-regional and systemic treatments [95,96] . The normalization of AFP (if elevated before treatment) after curative treatment is important to evaluate. After transplantation The surveillance modalities will be discussed with the trans- plant center. Patients should be closely monitored during the ﬁrst 2 years during which tumor recurrence rate is highest. Extrahepatic sites (particularly lungs) are the most frequently affected by recurrence. Surveillance methods should be adapted according to individual risk of recurrence (size and number of tumors, vascular invasion, degree of tumor differentiation, AFP). After resection Recommendations:The high recurrence rate supports close monitoring:• Clinical and biological evaluation (liver tests and AFP) every 3 months the ﬁrst year then every 6 months• Chest CT-scan every 6 months for 2 years• Liver imaging: MRI (or CT-scan if MRI is not possible) and liver US alternately every 3 months for 2 (to 3) years. After this monitoring, screening of new HCCs may be done by MRI or hepatic US every 6 months all life. (recommendation level: low) 11 J.F . Blanc, A Debaillon-Vesque, G. Roth et al. After percutaneous destruction Recommendations:The follow-up should ideally be done in the center that performed the procedure• MRI (or CT-scan) and US according to the habits cen- ters every 3 months for 2 to 3 years, then every 6 months. (recommendation level: low) After radiotherapy / SIRT Recommendations:MRI is the best technique but should not be pro- grammed too early (rather 3 months after the end of radiation). The radiological semiology must be deﬁned because it is often difﬁcult to distinguish per- sistence of viable tumor tissue with post-radiationperi-lesional hepatitis reaction. Further monitoring is not standardized but could be identical to the recommendations after percutaneous destruction (rec- ommendation level: expert opinion). After T ACE Recommendations:Control 6 weeks after TACE• Clinical and biological evaluation (liver tests and AFP)• Liver MRI (+ CT scan without injection in case of TACE with lipiodol®).Given the heterogeneity of practices, monitoring procedures will be adapted on a case-by-case basis and according to the rhythm of the sessions. (recommen- dation level: expert opinion). With systemic therapiesRecommendations:• Clinical monitoring and blood tests (liver tests and AFP) every month• Imaging every 2 to 3 months by thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan or hepatic MRI and chest CT .
