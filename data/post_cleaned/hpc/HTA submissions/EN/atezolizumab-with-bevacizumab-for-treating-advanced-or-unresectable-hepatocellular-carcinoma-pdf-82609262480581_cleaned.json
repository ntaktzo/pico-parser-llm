Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is a potential new treatment option. Clinical trial evidence shows that people with Child-Pugh grade A liver impairment and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 who have atezolizumab plus bevacizumab live longer and have longer before their disease progresses than people who have sorafenib. Results of an indirect comparison suggest that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is more effective than lenvatinib. But this is uncertain because there is no direct evidence comparing them. Despite the uncertainty in the indirect comparison, the most likely cost-effectiveness estimates for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with sorafenib and with lenvatinib are within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources.

The appraisal committee was aware that several issues were resolved during the techni engagement stage, and agreed that: • It is appropriate to cap the utility values for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) so that they do not exceed the age- and sex-matched level of the general population (issue 4, see technical report page 4). • Of the approaches to estimate drug dosing, the most plausible is expected to be between the company's scenario 2 and the ERG's scenario 2b (issue 5, see technica report page 4). • It is appropriate to include the costs of oral chemotherapy wastage in the analysis (issue 6, see technical report page 5). • It is acceptable to use overall-survival data from the IMbrave150 trial that have not been adjusted for the effect of subsequent treatments not recommended in Englan as long as the cost of those treatments is included (issues 3 and 7, see technical report pages 3 and 6). It recognised that there were remaining areas of uncertainty associated with the analyses presented, and took these into account in its decision making.

The committee noted that NICE guidance recommends sorafenib and lenvatinib for people with Child-Pugh grade A liver impairment. Lenvatinib is also recommended for people with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The clinical experts advised that both drugs are first-line treatment options in NHS practice, although there is some regional variation across England in which is preferred. They advised that deciding which treatment to use is usually done with the person with HCC, after discussing potential side effects with them. The Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead advised that about 60% of people have sorafenib and about 40% have lenvatinib. The committee concluded tha the company's proposed positioning in the treatment pathway is appropriate, and sorafenib and lenvatinib are both relevant comparators",

A random effects base-case network meta-analysis (NMA) of log-hazard ratios was done using 3 studies identified from a systematic literature review: • IMbrave150 (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with sorafenib) • REFLECT (lenvatinib compared with sorafenib) • CheckMate 459 (nivolumab compared with sorafenib). Responding to a clarification request from the ERG, the company did a fractional polynomial random effects NMA. The ERG advised that the company's approach was inconsistent because it used direct trial evidence from IMbrave150 to compare with sorafenib and indirect NMA evidence to compare with lenvatinib. The first approach (equivalent to a fixed effects model) allowed for less uncertainty than the NMA approach. The ERG explained that it would have preferred to have seen relative effects for all 3 treatments estimated using a single, coherent random effects model allowing for time-varying treatment effects. The committee noted that at technical engagement, a stakeholder advised that the company's NMA underestimated lenvatinib's effectiveness. The ERG advised that it did not believe this was a credible criticism, and that taking this into account would not address its other methodological concerns. The committee agreed that these methodological concerns increased the uncertainty of the NMA results. But it concluded that it would consider the company's NMA, including its potential limitations, in its decision making.",

This was informed by a panel of 6 clinical experts, who advised that the survival projections from the exponential © NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights Page 10 conditions#notice-of-rights). of 17 Atezolizumab with bevacizumab for treating advanced or unresectable hepatoc function most closely matched survival in NHS practice for sorafenib an lenvatinib. The panel suggested the generalised gamma function may also be plausible. The ERG noted that the exponential function did not provide a good statistical fit to the observed trial data and imposed an unsupported assumption of a constant mortality hazard over time. It explained that comparing survival projections from a closely controlled clinical trial, subject to strict patient selection criteria, with survival in NHS clinical practice is a flawed approach. This is because the trial was likely to achieve better outcomes than in NHS practice. It advised that the log-normal function was the best-fitting model, although the log- logistic and generalised gamma functions also fitted the data well. It explained that there was no strong clinical rationale to favour any of these 3 functions over the other. Therefore, its preferred choice would be the best-fitting log-normal function. After technical engagement, the company agreed that the log-normal distribution was clinically plausible The clinical experts advised that a constant mortality hazard over time was not plausible for people with advanced HCC. The committee agree with the ERG and clinical experts that the exponential function should n be used to model overall survival. It noted that lenvatinib was predicted to have higher or lower life expectancy than sorafenib, depending on th choice of overall-survival function. The committee understood that this was an artefact of the company's modelling approach. The choice of survival function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sorafenib was informed directly by IMbrave150 data. Survival for lenvatinib was informed by applying a hazard ratio from the NMA to the function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The committee agreed that it would have been preferable to apply the hazard ratio from the NMA for lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to the sorafenib survival function, because the drugs have a similar mechanism of action. However, it wou not expect this to have much effect on cost effectiveness. The committee concluded that it would consider cost-effectiveness results using the log-normal function to model survival, because this was the best-fitting function.

The ERG did exploratory analyses to test the effect on cost effectiveness of bodyweight (less than 60 kg compared with 60 kg or more) and region (all regions compared with excluding Asian regions, except Japan). The ERG explained that it was important to explore the potential effect of bodyweight because the dosing of lenvatinib and bevacizumab depend on bodyweight, so it affects associated drug costs. It explained that region was also potentially important because the underlying cause of HCC varies by region. Hepatitis C is more common in Europe, North America and Japan, and hepatitis B is more common in Asia (excluding Japan) and Africa. In Europe and North America, HCC is increasingly associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, obesity and exposure to toxic substances. The committee noted that IMbrave150 was done in 17 countries, with 40% of patients from Asia (excluding Japan). The ERG advised that considering the results for all combinations of the 2 bodyweight and 2 region categories allowed the committee to consider possible upper and lower bounds of the cost- effectiveness estimate for a given preferred analysis. The committee noted that the hazard ratio for overall survival was only marginally affected by bodyweight and region. It agreed that it would not be appropriate to make different recommendations for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab based on bodyweight or region. However, it felt that the ERG's exploratory analyses would be useful in considering the uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness estimates.

Interim funding will end 90 days after positive final guidance is published (or 30 days in the case of drugs with an Early Access to Medicines Scheme designation or fast track appraisal), at which point funding will switch to routine commissioning budgets.
