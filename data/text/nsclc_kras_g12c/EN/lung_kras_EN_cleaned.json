The\ncommittee discussed the arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund\nagreed by NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs\nFund methods guide (addendum). The company has expressed an\ninterest in the technology being considered for funding through the\nCancer Drugs Fund. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund\nmentioned that sotorasib needs to have plausible potential to be cost\neffective. The committee acknowledged that some of the clinical\nuncertainty may be addressed by collecting data on sotorasib through\nthe Cancer Drugs Fund. The company explained that the phase 3\nCodeBreaK200 trial, comparing sotorasib with docetaxel in a KRAS G12C\nmutation-positive population, is currently ongoing. It stated that this trial\nwill measure overall and progression-free survival, and health-related\nquality of life. It will also collect data from people with previously treated\ndisease. The committee agreed that some uncertainty may be resolved\nwith data from the CodeBreak200 trial. The committee recalled its\nconclusion that the current cost-effectiveness results were highly\nuncertain. It agreed that, with longer follow-up data from CodeBreaK100\non mean overall and progression-free survival, and direct comparative\nevidence with docetaxel from CodeBreaK200, sotorasib has the potential\nto be cost effective. Also, that additional evidence may change the\npreferred modelling assumptions outlined in section 3.13. The committee\nconcluded that sotorasib met the criteria to be considered for inclusion in\nthe Cancer Drugs Fund. So, it recommended sotorasib for use within the\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Further information can be found in NHS England's\nAppraisal and funding of cancer drugs from July 2016 (including the new\nCancer Drugs Fund) – A new deal for patients, taxpayers and industry.\nChapter 2 of Appraisal and funding of cancer drugs from July 2016 4.2\n(including the new Cancer Drugs Fund) – A new deal for patients,\ntaxpayers and industry states that for those drugs with a draft\nrecommendation for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund, interim funding will\nbe available (from the overall Cancer Drugs Fund budget) from the point\nof marketing authorisation, or from release of positive draft guidance,\nwhichever is later. Drugs that are recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund will be funded in line with the terms of their managed access\nagreement, after the period of interim funding. The NHS England and\nNHS Improvement Cancer Drugs Fund list provides up-to-date\ninformation on all cancer treatments recommended by NICE since 2016.\nThis includes whether they have received a marketing authorisation and\nbeen launched in the UK.\nThe Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on 4.3\nimplementing NICE technology appraisal guidance when the drug or\ntreatment, or other technology, is approved for use within the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a\ndrug or treatment, or other technology, for use within the Cancer Drugs\nFund, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it\nwithin 2 months of the first publication of the final appraisal document or\nagreement of a managed access agreement by the NHS in Wales,\nwhichever is the later.\n© NICE 2024.
