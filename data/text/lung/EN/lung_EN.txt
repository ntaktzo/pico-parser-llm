Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Access to services and referral
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 The importance of early diagnosis
1.1.1 The public needs to be better informed of the symptoms and signs that are
characteristic of lung cancer, through coordinated campaigning to raise
awareness. [2005]
Referral and indications for chest radiography
1.1.2 For guidance on referral, see the recommendations on referral for suspected lung
cancer in the NICE guideline on suspected cancer. [2019]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Communication
1.2 Helping people understand their condition and
the tests and treatments available
1.2.1 Find out what the person knows about their condition without assuming a level of
knowledge. Provide them with the opportunity to discuss tests and treatment
options in a private environment, with the support of family members or carers
(as appropriate), and give them time to make an informed choice. [2011]
1.2.2 Ensure that a lung cancer clinical nurse specialist is available at all stages of care
to support people and (as appropriate) their family members or carers. [2011]
1.2.3 Offer accurate and easy-to-understand information to people and their family
members or carers (as appropriate). Explain the tests and treatment options,
including potential survival benefits, side effects and effect on symptoms. [2011]
1.2.4 Consider tailor-made decision aids to help people to:
• understand the probable outcomes of treatment options
• think about the personal value they place on benefits versus harms of
treatment options
• feel supported in decision making
• move through the steps towards making a decision
• take part in decisions about their healthcare. [2011]
1.2.5 Offer people a record of all discussions that have taken place with them and a
copy of any correspondence with other healthcare professionals. Ensure all
communications are worded in such a way to assist understanding. [2011]
1.2.6 Respect the person's choice if they do not wish to confront future issues. [2011]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
1.2.7 Avoid giving people unexpected bad news in writing. Only give unexpected bad
news by phone in exceptional circumstances. [2011]
1.2.8 Offer to discuss end-of-life care with the person sensitively and when
appropriate. Wherever possible, avoid leaving this discussion until the terminal
stages of the illness. [2011]
1.2.9 Document discussions with the person about end-of-life care. In particular,
document:
• their specific concerns
• their understanding of their illness and its prognosis
• important values or personal goals for care
• their preferences for the types of care or treatment that may be beneficial in
the future and their availability. [2011]
1.2.10 Share information between healthcare professionals about:
• any problems the person has
• the management plan
• what the person has been told
• what the person has understood (if possible)
• the involvement of other agencies
• any advance decision made by the person. [2011]

Diagnosis and staging
1.3 Effectiveness of diagnostic and staging
investigations
1.3.1 Only use sputum cytology for investigation in people with suspected lung cancer
who have centrally placed nodules or masses and who decline or cannot tolerate
bronchoscopy or other invasive tests. [2005]
1.3.2 Offer people with known or suspected lung cancer a contrast-enhanced chest CT
scan to further the diagnosis and stage the disease. Include the liver, adrenals
and lower neck in the scan. The guideline committee also recognised that
contrast medium should only be given with caution to people with known renal
impairment. [2005, amended 2019]
1.3.3 When assessing mediastinal and chest wall invasion:
• be aware that CT alone may not be reliable
• consider other techniques such as ultrasound if there is doubt
• be aware that surgical assessment may be necessary if there are no
contraindications to resection. [2005]
1.3.4 Ensure that all people with lung cancer who could potentially have treatment with
curative intent are offered positron-emission tomography CT (PET-CT) before
treatment. [2011]
1.3.5 Every cancer alliance should have a system of rapid access to PET-CT scanning
for eligible people. [2005, amended 2019]
1.3.6 Do not routinely use MRI to assess the stage of the primary tumour (T-stage) in
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). [2005]
1.3.7 Use MRI when necessary to assess the extent of disease, for people with
© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 9 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
superior sulcus tumours. [2005]
1.3.8 Offer endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-
TBNA) for biopsy of paratracheal and peri-bronchial intra-parenchymal lung
lesions. [2011]
1.3.9 Every cancer alliance should have at least 1 centre with EBUS and/or endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) to ensure timely access. [2011]
1.3.10 Audit the local test performance of EBUS-TBNA and endoscopic ultrasound-
guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). [2011, amended 2019]
1.3.11 When taking samples, ensure they are adequate (without unacceptable risk to
the person) to permit pathological diagnosis, including tumour subtyping and
assessment of predictive markers. [2011, amended 2019]
1.3.12 For guidance on EGFR-TK mutation testing, see the NICE diagnostics guidance
on EGFR-TK mutation testing in adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-
small-cell lung cancer. [2019]
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on effectiveness of
diagnostic and staging investigations.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A:
Investigations for staging the mediastinum.
Sequence of investigations
1.3.13 Choose investigations that give the most information about diagnosis and staging
with the least risk to the person. Think carefully before performing a test that
gives only diagnostic pathology when information on staging is also needed to
guide treatment. [2011]
1.3.14 Perform contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, liver adrenals and lower neck before
any biopsy procedure. [2005, amended 2019]

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Peripheral primary tumour
1.3.15 Offer image-guided biopsy to people with peripheral lung lesions when treatment
can be planned on the basis of this test. [2011, amended 2019]
1.3.16 Biopsy any enlarged intrathoracic nodes (10 mm or larger maximum short axis on
CT) or other lesions in preference to the primary lesion if determination of nodal
stage affects treatment. Some people with lung cancer will not be well enough for
treatment with curative intent. This needs to be taken into account when
choosing diagnostic and staging investigations. [2011, amended 2019]
Central primary tumour
1.3.17 Offer flexible bronchoscopy to people with central lesions on CT if nodal staging
does not influence treatment. [2011, amended 2019]
Intrathoracic lymph node assessment
1.3.18 Offer PET-CT as the preferred first test after CT with a low probability of nodal
malignancy (lymph nodes below 10 mm maximum short axis on CT), for people
with lung cancer who could potentially have treatment with curative intent. [2011,
amended 2019]
1.3.19 Offer PET-CT (if not already done), followed by EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA, to
people with suspected lung cancer who have enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes
(lymph nodes greater than or equal to 10 mm short axis on CT) and who could
potentially have treatment with curative intent. [2019]
1.3.20 Evaluate PET-CT-positive or enlarged intrathoracic nodes using a systematic
approach (sampling any suspicious node on CT, PET or USS) with EBUS-TBNA
and/or EUS-FNA if nodal status would affect the treatment plan. [2019]
1.3.21 Consider surgical mediastinal staging for people with a negative EBUS-TBNA or
EUS-FNA if clinical suspicion of nodal malignancy is high and nodal status would
affect their treatment plan. [2019]

they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on EBUS-TBNA and
EUS-FNA.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A:
Investigations for staging the mediastinum.
Further staging
1.3.22 Confirm the presence of isolated distant metastases/synchronous tumours by
biopsy or further imaging (for example, MRI or PET-CT) in people being
considered for treatment with curative intent. [2011]
1.3.23 Do not offer dedicated brain imaging to people with clinical stage I NSCLC who
have no neurological symptoms and are having treatment with curative intent.
[2019]
1.3.24 Offer contrast-enhanced brain CT to people with clinical stage II NSCLC who are
having treatment with curative intent. If CT shows suspected brain metastases,
offer contrast-enhanced brain MRI. [2019]
1.3.25 Offer contrast-enhanced brain MRI for people with stage III NSCLC who are
having treatment with curative intent. [2019]
1.3.26 Offer people with clinical features suggestive of intracranial pathology CT of the
head followed by MRI if normal, or MRI as an initial test. [2011]
1.3.27 Perform an X-ray as the first test for people with localised signs or symptoms of
bone metastasis. If the results are negative or inconclusive, offer bone
scintigraphy or an MRI scan. [2005]
1.3.28 Avoid bone scintigraphy when PET-CT has not shown bone metastases. [2011]

Brain imaging for people with NSCLC selected for treatment with curative intent.
Organisational factors relevant to diagnosis and staging
1.3.29 Provide treatment without undue delay for people who have lung cancer that is
suitable for radical treatment or chemotherapy, or who need radiotherapy or
ablative treatment for relief of symptoms. [2005, amended 2019]
Multidisciplinary teams
1.3.30 Refer all people with a suspected diagnosis of lung cancer to a member of a lung
cancer multidisciplinary team (usually a chest physician). [2005]
1.3.31 The care of all people with a working diagnosis of lung cancer should be
discussed at a lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting. [2005]
Fast track lung clinics
1.3.32 Provide fast-track lung cancer clinics (previously known as early diagnosis clinics
and rapid access clinics) for investigating suspected lung cancer, because they
are associated with faster diagnosis and less anxiety. [2005]
Cancer clinical nurse specialists
1.3.33 All cancer units/centres should have one or more trained lung cancer clinical
nurse specialists to:
• see people before, at the time of and after diagnosis

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
• provide continuing support
• facilitate communication between the secondary care team (including the
multidisciplinary team), the person's GP, the community team and the person
with lung cancer
• help people access advice and support whenever they need it. [2005,

Treatment
1.4 Stop smoking interventions and services
1.4.1 Inform people that smoking increases the risk of pulmonary complications after
lung cancer surgery. [2011]
1.4.2 Advise people to stop smoking as soon as the diagnosis of lung cancer is
suspected and tell them why this is important. [2011]
1.4.3 Offer nicotine replacement therapy and other therapies to help people to stop
smoking in line with the NICE guideline on tobacco: preventing uptake, promoting
quitting and treating dependence and the NICE technology appraisal guidance on
varenicline for smoking cessation. [2011]
1.4.4 Do not postpone surgery for lung cancer to allow people to stop smoking. [2011]
1.5 Assessing people with non-small-cell lung
cancer for treatment with curative intent
Perioperative mortality
1.5.1 When evaluating surgery as an option for people with NSCLC, consider using a
global risk score such as Thoracoscore to estimate the risk of death. Ensure the
person is aware of the risk before they give consent for surgery. [2011]
Cardiovascular function
1.5.2 Avoid surgery within 30 days of myocardial infarction. [2011]
1.5.3 Seek a cardiology review in people with an active cardiac condition, or 3 or more

risk factors, or poor cardiac functional capacity. [2011]
1.5.4 Offer surgery without further investigations to people with 2 or fewer risk factors
and good cardiac functional capacity. [2011]
1.5.5 Optimise any primary cardiac treatment and begin secondary prophylaxis for
coronary disease as soon as possible. [2011]
1.5.6 Continue anti-ischaemic treatment in the perioperative period, including aspirin,
statins and beta-blockers. [2011]
1.5.7 For people with coronary stents, discuss perioperative anti-platelet treatment
with a cardiologist. [2011]
1.5.8 Consider revascularisation (percutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass
grafting) before surgery for people with chronic stable angina and conventional
indications for revascularisation. [2011]
Lung function
1.5.9 Perform spirometry and transfer factor (TLCO) in all people being considered for
treatment with curative intent. [2011, amended 2019]
1.5.10 Offer people surgery if they have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1)
within normal limits and good exercise tolerance. [2011]
1.5.11 When considering surgery perform a functional segment count to predict
postoperative lung function. [2011]
1.5.12 Offer people with predicted postoperative FEV 1 or TLCO below 30% the option of
treatment with curative intent if they accept the risks of dyspnoea and
associated complications. [2011, amended 2019]
1.5.13 Consider using shuttle walk testing (using a distance walked of more than 400 m
as a cut-off for good function) to assess the fitness of people with moderate to
high risk of postoperative dyspnoea. [2011]

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
1.5.14 Consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing to measure oxygen uptake (VO max)
2
and assess lung function in people with moderate to high risk of postoperative
dyspnoea, using more than 15 ml/kg/minute as a cut-off for good function. [2011]
Assessment before radiotherapy with curative intent
1.5.15 A clinical oncologist specialising in thoracic oncology should determine suitability
for radiotherapy with curative intent, taking into account performance status and
comorbidities. [2011]
1.6 Surgery and radiotherapy with curative intent
for non-small-cell lung cancer
Surgery
1.6.1 For people with NSCLC who are well enough and for whom treatment with
curative intent is suitable, offer lobectomy (either open or thoracoscopic). [2019]
1.6.2 Offer more extensive surgery (bronchoangioplastic surgery, bilobectomy,
pneumonectomy) only when needed to obtain clear margins. [2011]
1.6.3 Perform hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling or en bloc resection for all
people having surgery with curative intent. [2011]
1.6.4 For people with T 3 NSCLC with chest wall involvement who are having surgery,
aim for complete resection of the tumour using either extrapleural or en bloc
chest wall resection. [2005]
Surgery or radiotherapy for people not having lobectomy
1.6.5 For people with stage I–IIA (T 1 a–T 2 b, N 0, M 0) NSCLC who decline lobectomy or
in whom it is contraindicated, offer radical radiotherapy with stereotactic ablative

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
radiotherapy (SABR) or sublobar resection. [2019]
Radical radiotherapy for people not having surgery
1.6.6 All people should have pulmonary function tests (including lung volumes and
transfer factor) before radical radiotherapy for NSCLC. [2005]
1.6.7 People receiving radiotherapy with curative intent should be part of a national
quality assurance programme. [2011]
1.6.8 For people with stage I–IIA (T 1 a–T 2 b, N 0, M 0) NSCLC who decline surgery or in
whom any surgery is contraindicated, offer SABR. If SABR is contraindicated,
offer either conventional or hyperfractionated radiotherapy. [2019]
1.6.9 For eligible people with stage IIIA NSCLC who cannot tolerate or who decline
chemoradiotherapy (with or without surgery), consider radical radiotherapy
(either conventional or hyperfractionated). [2019]
1.6.10 For eligible people with stage IIIB NSCLC who cannot tolerate or who decline
chemoradiotherapy, consider radical radiotherapy (either conventional or
hyperfractionated). [2019]
Radiotherapy fractionation
1.6.11 If using SABR, follow the SABR Consortium guidance on fractionation. [2019]
1.6.12 If conventionally fractionated radical radiotherapy is used, offer either:
• 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or
• 60–66 Gy in 30–33 fractions over 6–6½ weeks. [2019]

Radiotherapy with curative intent for NSCLC.
1.7 Combination treatment for non-small-cell lung
cancer
1.7.1 Consider chemoradiotherapy for people with stage II or III NSCLC that are not
suitable for or decline surgery. Balance potential benefit in survival with the risk
of additional toxicities. [2011]
1.7.2 Ensure that all people for whom multimodality treatment is potentially suitable
(surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in any combination) are assessed by a
thoracic oncologist and by a thoracic surgeon. [2011]
1.7.3 Offer postoperative chemotherapy to people with good performance status
(WHO 0 or 1) and T 1 a–4, N 1–2, M 0 NSCLC. [2011]
1.7.4 Consider postoperative chemotherapy for people with good performance status
(WHO 0 or 1) and T 2 b–4, N 0, M 0 NSCLC with tumours greater than 4 cm in
diameter. [2011]
1.7.5 Offer a cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen for adjuvant
chemotherapy. [2011]
1.7.6 For people with stage I–II NSCLC that are suitable for surgery, do not offer neo-
adjuvant treatment outside a clinical trial. [2011, amended 2019]
1.7.7 Ensure eligible people have the benefit of detailed discussion of the risks and
benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy. [2011]
1.7.8 Treat Pancoast tumours in the same way as other types of NSCLC. Offer

multimodality therapy according to resectability, stage of the tumour and
performance status of the person. [2011]
1.7.9 For people with operable stage IIIA–N 2 NSCLC who can have surgery and are well
enough for multimodality therapy, consider chemoradiotherapy with surgery.
[2019]
1.7.10 Discuss the benefits and risks with the person before starting chemoradiotherapy
with surgery, including that:
• chemoradiotherapy with surgery improves progression-free survival
• chemoradiotherapy with surgery may improve overall survival. [2019]
1.7.11 For people with stage IIIA–N 2 NSCLC who are having chemoradiotherapy and
surgery, ensure that their surgery is scheduled for 3 to 5 weeks after the
chemoradiotherapy. [2019]
1.7.12 Multidisciplinary teams that provide chemoradiotherapy with surgery should have
expertise in the combined therapy and in all of the individual components. [2019]
1.7.13 Centres performing lung resections for lung cancer should validate their data for
the Royal College of Physicians Lung Cancer Clinical Outcomes publication and
the National Lung Cancer Audit. [2019]

Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect services. They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the
committee's discussion.
Diagnosis and staging
Why the committee made the recommendations
Effectiveness of diagnostic and staging investigations
Recommendation 1.3.10
Clinical audit is an important tool for maintaining high standards in the use of
endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and
endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). This is consistent with
the British Thoracic Society guideline and quality standards (which are accredited by
NICE).
EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA
Recommendations 1.3.19 to 1.3.21
The recommendations cover:
• initial invasive investigations for people with an intermediate probability of mediastinal
malignancy
• subsequent investigations for people with a high probability of mediastinal malignancy,
when neck ultrasound and biopsy are negative.
In these circumstances, when compared with alternative investigations, EBUS-TBNA and
EUS-FNA:
• produce a diagnosis and stage faster than bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy
© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 37
conditions#notice-of-rights). of 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
• are more acceptable to patients than surgery
• reduce the need for further investigations and hospital visits compared with
bronchoscopy.
Surgical mediastinal staging
Recommendation 1.3.21
There is evidence that surgical staging is useful when EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA are
negative but clinical suspicion of mediastinal malignancy is high. While there are potential
harms from the invasive nature of surgical staging, there is no evidence that these
outweigh the benefits in this population.
Procedures that were not recommended
Transthoracic needle biopsy, bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are no
longer recommended for staging lung cancer in intrathoracic lymph nodes because:
• bronchoscopy and non-ultrasound-guided TBNA are unlikely to reach the minimum
sensitivity required by the British Thoracic quality standards and
• they may discourage people from having more effective procedures (such as EBUS-
TBNA) and subsequent investigations.
The word 'fibreoptic' has been removed because bronchoscopy can be fibreoptic, video or
hybrid.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations on PET-CT reflect current practice, so will not incur an extra cost.
The recommendations on EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA will reinforce best practice and result
in a more streamlined diagnostic service with more timely diagnosis and staging.
The surgical mediastinal staging recommendation will also reinforce best practice and
restrict this procedure to people most likely to benefit.

conditions#notice-of-rights). of 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Brain imaging for people having treatment with
curative intent
Recommendations 1.3.23 to 1.3.25
Why the committee made the recommendations
Brain imaging is helpful before starting treatment with curative intent, because if brain
metastases are detected then the treatment plan is likely to change. However, routine
brain imaging is expensive, and the evidence showed that it does not always offer a good
balance of benefits and costs.
In people with stage II and IIIA disease, the benefits of brain imaging outweigh the costs
because:
• brain metastases are more common than in stage I disease
• people can start early treatment for metastases if they are identified, which improves
prognosis
• some people with brain metastases will not have radical treatment (depending on
factors such as the number of metastases, prognosis and patient preference), and this
reduces costs.
In people with clinical stage I NSCLC and no neurological symptoms, the prevalence of
detectable brain metastases is fairly low (around 4%) compared with people with stage II
or IIIA disease. People with stage I NSCLC who do have brain metastases often still have
radical lung treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA
NSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of
people having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging in this population
are too low to justify the costs.
The 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of imaging after the
treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient
to conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committee
made a recommendation for research on routine brain imaging with CT at initial diagnosis
and/or staging.

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
How the recommendations might affect practice
Practice in this area is variable. The committee estimated that the recommendations will
increase the number of people who have brain imaging. In turn, they thought this should
prevent the use of treatment options (such as lobectomy and sublobar resection) in some
patients for whom it is not expected to be beneficial. The recommendations may also lead
to an increase in radical radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and brain surgery. These
treatments would be expected to improve the person's prognosis, although each
treatment would carry its own risks and side effects.

Surgery and radiotherapy with curative intent for
non-small-cell lung cancer
Recommendations 1.6.1 and 1.6.5 to 1.6.12
Why the committee made the recommendations
For people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are well enough and for whom
treatment with curative intent is suitable, the evidence showed that lobectomy provides
better survival outcomes than stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Lobectomy is a
good compromise between preserving pulmonary function and being more likely to
remove cancerous cells compared with sublobar resection.
For people with stage I–IIA (T 1 a–T 2 b, N 0, M 0) NSCLC, the evidence showed that:
• if they decline lobectomy or it is contraindicated, sublobar resection and SABR both
provide better survival outcomes than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy,
although it is not clear which of these 2 is better
• if they decline any surgery or it is contraindicated, SABR provides better survival
outcomes than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, and people often prefer it
because it involves fewer hospital visits
• if surgery and SABR are contraindicated, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy
provides better survival outcomes than no radiotherapy.

conditions#notice-of-rights). of 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
For people with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC who cannot tolerate chemoradiotherapy or who
decline it, the evidence was not strong enough to recommend conventional radiotherapy
over hyper-fractionated regimens or vice versa. However, people who cannot tolerate
chemoradiotherapy may also be unable to tolerate radical radiotherapy, so this will not be
an option for everyone with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC. For an explanation of the
recommendations covering surgery in this group, see the rationale on management of
stage IIIA-N 2 NSCLC.
55 Gy in 20 fractions is the most common conventional radical radiotherapy regimen in the
UK. If conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is used, a total radiation dose of 60 Gy
provides better survival outcomes and fewer adverse events than 74 Gy. A total dose of
60 to 66 Gy is also normal NHS practice.
There are not many randomised controlled trials comparing SABR with surgery (lobectomy
or sublobar resection). SABR is non-invasive, so if it is as effective as surgery then it may
be a preferable option for many people with lung cancer. There are also various factors
that may make SABR less costly than surgery. For example, it is usually delivered as
outpatient treatment. There might also be subgroups for whom different forms of surgery
or SABR might be the most cost-effective options. The committee made a
recommendation for research on SABR compared with surgery to investigate these
uncertainties.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The new recommendations on SABR are a change from the 2011 guideline and improve
choice for people with NSCLC. However, practice has also changed since 2011, and SABR
is now widely used, so implementing the recommendations may not involve a significant
change in practice. The remaining changes to the recommendations reflect current
practice.

Management of operable stage IIIA–N 2 non-small-
cell lung cancer
Recommendations 1.7.9 to 1.7.13
© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 41
conditions#notice-of-rights). of 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Why the committee made the recommendations
The available evidence showed that chemoradiotherapy and surgery are more effective
than chemoradiotherapy alone in people who are well enough for surgery and when the
disease is operable. For chemotherapy and surgery, there was no evidence that survival
outcomes were better than for chemoradiotherapy, so the additional costs of including
surgery outweighed the benefits.
The key benefit associated with chemoradiotherapy and surgery is the longer
progression-free survival time. An analysis of multiple trials showed improved progression-
free survival and cost effectiveness for chemoradiotherapy with surgery, compared with
chemoradiotherapy alone. There was an 89% probability that chemoradiotherapy and
surgery improved average overall survival time compared with chemoradiotherapy.
However, the evidence in favour of chemoradiotherapy and surgery involved indirect
comparisons, and no head-to-head trials showed meaningful differences in overall survival
for any of the interventions. And as with any major surgery, there is a perioperative
mortality risk for people who have chemoradiotherapy and surgery.
The 3 to 5 week wait for surgery is recommended to give people time to recover from the
chemoradiotherapy.
Chemoradiotherapy with surgery is not often offered in current practice. In addition, there
are specific factors to take into account when offering all these treatments together.
Therefore, multidisciplinary teams providing it should have expertise both in the combined
therapy, and in all the individual components.
Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a variety of NSCLC indications but there
is currently no evidence on whether it is clinically or cost effective for people with stage
IIIA-N 2 NSCLC following surgery. The committee made a recommendation for research on
immunotherapy after multimodality treatment to address this.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee felt that chemoradiotherapy and surgery is offered far less often than
chemoradiotherapy alone or chemotherapy and surgery for people with NSCLC stage IIIA-
N 2. Therefore, these recommendations could lead to a change in current practice.

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
First-line treatment for limited-stage disease
small-cell lung cancer
Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.5
Why the committee changed the recommendations
The evidence showed a survival benefit from twice-daily radiotherapy compared with
once-daily. However, the committee agreed that some people with small-cell lung cancer
will not be well enough to tolerate twice-daily radiotherapy, so they recommended giving
people the option of once-daily radiotherapy.
The committee noted that, in practice, radiotherapy is not started in chemotherapy cycle 1,
because this is when planning for the radiotherapy often takes place (see the
recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in the section
on first-line treatment for limited-stage disease small-cell lung cancer). However, there
was no new evidence on when to start radiotherapy, so the 2019 recommendation on this
is the same as the original 2011 recommendation.
There were limited data available on whether continuous radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy was more effective than alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Because of the limited data, and the committee's experience that people prefer to
complete treatment as quickly as possible, the 2019 recommendation on concurrent
therapy (see the recommendation on twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent
chemotherapy) is the same as the 2011 recommendation.

Thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial
irradiation in small-cell lung cancer
Recommendations 1.12.3 and 1.12.4
© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 43
conditions#notice-of-rights). of 51
Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Why the committee made the recommendations
Thoracic radiotherapy
There was some uncertainty in the evidence. However, the study most relevant to UK
practice showed that thoracic radiotherapy improves long-term survival for people who
have had a partial or complete response to chemotherapy, if they live longer than 1 year
after the radiotherapy. The committee specified that thoracic radiotherapy should be
given alongside prophylactic cranial irradiation. This is to match recommendation 1.4.55. In
addition, the reviewed clinical trials gave thoracic radiotherapy alongside prophylactic
cranial irradiation.
Prophylactic cranial irradiation
The evidence showed that prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival versus best
supportive care.
Prophylactic cranial irradiation can adversely affect quality of life, and the survival benefits
are limited. There is also some evidence from a study outside the UK that routine MRI
follow-up may be more cost effective. The committee made a recommendation for
research on prophylactic cranial irradiation compared with routine MRI follow-up in
extensive-stage SCLC, to provide evidence more relevant to the UK and to see if MRI
could identify people who need whole-brain radiotherapy and so reduce the number of
people having unnecessary treatment.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Thoracic radiotherapy
The 2011 recommendation only recommended thoracic radiotherapy for people with a
complete response to chemotherapy at distant sites. Therefore, this recommendation
could increase the number of people who are given thoracic radiotherapy.
Prophylactic cranial irradiation
It is likely that the recommendation reflects current clinical practice.

Context
Over 46,000 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK in 2015. An estimated 89%
of lung cancers are preventable, with 86% of these linked to smoking, 13% to occupational
exposure, 9% to dietary factors and 7.8% to air pollution. Lung cancer can be linked to
more than one cause.
In 2015 in the UK, over 35,000 people died from lung cancer. The overall mortality rate
from lung cancer has decreased by 9% over the last decade. However, while there has
been a decrease of 19% in mortality rates in men, there has been an increase of 2% in
women. This is linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and is driven by an increased
incidence of lung cancer in older women.
In the UK, lung cancer is more common in people of European family origin than in people
of African or Asian family origin. It is strongly linked to socioeconomic deprivation. There
are many risk factors for lung cancer, including age, genetics, lifestyle (especially smoking)
and occupation. Lung cancer is estimated to cost the UK economy £2.4 billion per year.
Note: all statistics in this section are from Cancer Research UK's Lung Cancer Statistics.
Current practice
Lung cancer is diagnosed and staged using a variety of tests, including chest X-rays, CT or
positron-emission tomography CT (PET-CT). Lung cancer samples are commonly acquired
for diagnosis using bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or a percutaneous
procedure (guided by CT or ultrasound).
Lung cancer has 2 main types:
• non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is more common and spreads more slowly
• small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is rarer and spreads more quickly.
Treatment depends on the type, size, position and stage of the cancer, and the person's
health. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, systemic anti-cancer therapies, surgery,
supportive care cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and ablation.

Lung cancer: diagnosis and management (NG 122)
Since 2011, when the NICE lung cancer guideline was last updated, there have been
changes in the way that lung cancer is diagnosed and treated. The Royal College of
Physicians' National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2016 identified that only 72% of
people have pathological confirmation of their lung cancer. There is also inconsistency in
the availability of molecular testing in lung cancer diagnosis.
NHS England has taken steps to shorten the time to treatment, as well as improve access
to and uptake of radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is routinely
used for certain subgroups of people with early-stage NSCLC. There are now a variety of
licensed immunotherapies and biological targeted therapies for treating advanced NSCLC,
and NICE has published technology appraisals covering many of these.

Update information
March 2024: We have removed the following systemic anti-cancer therapy treatment
pathways for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after the withdrawal of the NICE
technology appraisal guidance on mobocertinib:
• EGFRex 20 insertion positive, PD-L 1 less than 50%, for both squamous and non-
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
• EGFRex 20 insertion positive, PD-L 1 50% or higher, for both squamous and non-
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.
July 2023: We have made the following changes to the systemic anti-cancer therapy
treatment pathways for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer:
• added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on dabrafenib and trametinib, for
squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
• added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on mobocertinib, for non-squamous
non-small-cell lung cancer
• added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on selpercatinib, for squamous and
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
• updated the treatment options in the pathways for EGFR-TK positive, KRAS G 12 C
positive and METex 14 skipping alteration non-small-cell lung cancer.
March 2023: We added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on mobocertinib to the
systemic anti-cancer therapy treatment pathways for advanced non-small-cell lung
cancer.
September 2022: We added the NICE technology appraisal guidance on tepotinib to the
systemic anti-cancer therapy treatment pathways for advanced non-small-cell lung
cancer.
August 2022: We have changed how the information on systemic anti-cancer therapy for
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is presented.

visual summaries, and as recommendations in the guideline.
• In the 2022 update, this information is presented in separate treatment pathways. The
recommendations have been incorporated into the treatment pathways and have been
removed from the guideline. This is a presentational change only, and the
recommendations still apply.
The sources for the 2019 and 2022 versions are the same:
• NICE technology appraisal guidance
• Recommendations from the 2019 version of the guideline that have been incorporated
into the treatment pathways
• Input from the 2019 guideline committee and other topic experts.
The 2022 treatment pathways were developed following an interim process to develop
visualisations of treatment options.
March 2019: We reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on mediastinal
lymph node assessment, brain imaging, prophylactic cranial irradiation, radical
radiotherapy and operable stage IIIA disease. These recommendations are marked [2019].
We also made some changes without an evidence review:
• Recommendations 1.3.2, 1.3.10, 1.3.14, 1.3.15, 1.4.13, 1.4.16 and 1.4.38 were updated to
fit with the recommendations made in the 2019 evidence review, and to reflect current
best practice.
• Recommendations 1.3.5, 1.3.11, 1.3.18 were updated to reflect current terminology.
• Recommendation 1.3.17 has had 'fibreoptic' removed, because bronchoscopy can be
fibreoptic, video or hybrid.
• Recommendation 1.3.30 has had a reference to the Welsh Government and
Department of Health removed, as the NHS England optimal lung cancer pathway now
covers this area.
• Recommendation 1.3.34 was updated to reflect current practice and to be in line with
the NICE quality standard on lung cancer.
These recommendations are marked [2005, amended 2019] or [2011, amended 2019].
