Overview 
This guideline co vers assessing t he familial and genetic risk of ha ving a pat hogenic v ariant 
associat ed wit h ovarian cancer in adult s. 
In women, trans men and non-binar y people wit h female r eproductiv e organs ( ovaries, 
fallopian tubes and/or a ut erus), ha ving a pat hogenic v ariant incr eases t he risk of 
developing o varian cancer (f amilial o varian cancer). As w ell as risk assessment, t his 
guideline co vers risk management and decision-making suppor t for people born wit h 
female r eproductiv e organs who ha ve, or ar e at risk of ha ving, a pat hogenic v ariant 
associat ed wit h ovarian cancer . 
Men, trans w omen and non-binar y people born wit h male r eproductiv e organs cannot 
develop o varian cancer , but if t hey have a pat hogenic v ariant associat ed wit h ovarian 
cancer , they can pass t he variant on t o their childr en, and ma y be at risk of de veloping 
other cancers. This guideline co vers risk assessment, but it does not co ver managing risk 
or decision-making suppor t for people born wit h male r eproductiv e organs. 
NICE has also pr oduced a guideline on t he recognition and initial management of o varian 
cancer . 
Who is i t for? 
• Healt hcare professionals w orking in primar y, secondar y and t ertiary car e 
• Cancer alliances 
• Commissioners (including clinical commissioning gr oups and NHS England specialised 
commissioning) 
• Voluntar y sect or or ganisations

Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice or ser vices. 
Organisa tion o f ser vices 
Recommendations 1 .1.1 to 1.1.9 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was limit ed evidence, wit h a small number of studies and uncer tainties about t he 
effect siz e and t he wa y the studies w ere conduct ed, so t he committ ee based t he 
recommendations on t he evidence and t heir kno wledge and e xperience. 
Commissioners and ser vice pr oviders in all settings (primar y car e, genetics 
services, gynaecology oncology and f amilial o varian cancer multidisciplinar y 
services) 
The committ ee discussed t heir e xperience of v ariations in ho w people ar e referred fr om 
healt hcare professionals, f or example, whet her people ar e referred first t o specialist 
gynaecological ser vices or dir ectly to genetic specialist ser vices. The y decided t o 
recommend dir ect r eferral t o mak e ser vices mor e efficient, t oget her wit h wa ys of making 
the referral pr ocess smoot her (including clear er referral crit eria). 
The committ ee discussed t heir e xperience of wh y people who ma y be at risk of ha ving a 
pathogenic v ariant associat ed wit h ovarian cancer do not access ser vices. The y agr eed 
that people fr om under -represent ed or underser ved gr oups ma y kno w that t he guideline 
applies t o them but ma y need mor e suppor t to access ser vices. This could include people 
who ar e physically disabled, people wit h neur odevelopmental conditions or a learning 
disability , people fr om Black, Asian and et hnic minority back grounds, and people who ar e 
LGBTQ+. In addition, people ma y not r ealise t hat t hey ma y be at risk of ha ving a 
pathogenic v ariant associat ed wit h ovarian cancer because t hey cannot de velop o varian 
cancer , for example, men, trans w omen and non-binar y people born wit h male 
reproductiv e organs. The committ ee agr eed t hat t hese gr oups need encouragement t o 
discuss r eferral t o genetics ser vices. The committ ee fur ther not ed that healt hcare Ovarian cancer: identifying and managing f amilial and genetic risk (NG2 41)

of 67
professionals ar e not alwa ys awar e of t he pot ential barriers, and agr eed t hat training and 
information w ould help raise awar eness. 
The committ ee also not ed that t here is an o verall lack of awar eness, which is a barrier t o 
identification of people at risk. The y decided, based on t heir e xperience, t hat it should be 
within the remit of commissioners and ser vice pr oviders t o raise awar eness bot h among 
healt hcare professionals and t he general public. A lack of kno wledge about who ma y be 
eligible (f or example, people fr om at -risk populations) could lead t o a dela y in assessment 
and identification of people at risk, and t his has pot entially serious consequences, such as 
the risk of de veloping o varian cancer . Including t his inf ormation in continuing education 
programmes and ha ving public awar eness initiativ es could be wa ys to help raise 
awar eness. 
Primar y car e ser vices 
The committ ee discussed t hat primar y car e has limit ed capacity t o seek out pot ential 
index cases. Ho wever, if a f amily hist ory is kno wn (including f amily hist ory from a 
population wit h incr eased risk), a person is kno wn to be fr om an at -risk population or a 
person has o varian cancer , GPs can r efer people dir ectly to genetics ser vices. The 
committ ee also not ed that inf ormation and suppor t should be pr ovided in primar y car e to 
enable people t o mak e informed decisions. 
Genetics ser vices 
In the committ ee's e xperience, t here is litt le variation in t he responsibilities of genetics 
services because t heir ser vices ar e specified b y NHS England commissioning guidance  for 
medical genetics ser vices. The committ ee agr eed t o list t he main r esponsibilities so t hat 
people kno w what t o expect when t hey are being r eferred. 
The committ ee discussed whet her rar er types of o varian cancer w ould be t he 
responsibility of genetics ser vices or gynaecology oncology ser vices. It was agr eed t hat 
the car e of t hese types of genetic conditions (see t he non-epit helial o varian cancers list ed 
in recommendation 1 .4.6) is v ery specialised and t hat t herefore genetic counselling and 
genetic t esting should be wit hin the remit of genetics ser vices. 
Gynaecology oncology multidisciplinar y team 
Based on t he evidence about mainstr eam genetic t esting and counselling, which sho wed Ovarian cancer: identifying and managing f amilial and genetic risk (NG2 41)

services run mor e efficient ly and f aster, the committ ee agr eed t hat mainstr eam genetic 
counselling and genetic t esting of an yone wit h a hist opat hological diagnosis of epit helial 
ovarian cancer should be carried out b y their gynaecology oncology multidisciplinar y 
team. 
Familial o varian cancer multidisciplinar y team 
Having a pat hogenic v ariant or being abo ve a threshold f or testing leads t o man y decisions 
having t o be made during t he person's lif e, for example, in r elation t o fertility and risk -
reducing sur gery. The committ ee ackno wledged t hat ser vices run mor e eff ectiv ely when 
roles and r esponsibilities ar e defined so t hat staff and people using t he ser vices kno w 
what t o expect. The y not ed that t he person's car e would need t o be coor dinat ed because 
different ser vices ma y become r elevant t o them at diff erent point s in t heir lif e (including, 
for example, pr oviding inf ormation and suppor t, and carr ying out r eviews). The committ ee 
decided t hat a multidisciplinar y appr oach w ould be beneficial and t hat t his should 
continue t hroughout t he person's lif e. The y clarified t hat t he person w ould usually see t he 
appr opriat e person r elevant t o their cir cumstances and w ould not usually see t he entir e 
team. 
Based on t heir e xperience, t he committ ee specified t he exper tise t hat is essential f or the 
familial o varian cancer multidisciplinar y team ( core exper tise t hat is alwa ys requir ed) and 
the ot her ser vices t hat t he multidisciplinar y team w ould need access t o, such as 
menopause ser vices. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect ser vices 
The committ ee discussed t hat some of t hese ser vices alr eady e xist but t hat t here is 
variation in practice in ho w referral betw een t hem tak es place and ho w they are set up. 
The committ ee not ed that br oader eligibility crit eria f or genetic t esting ma y result in mor e 
pressur e on e xisting ser vices, such as primar y car e. Ho wever, people ar e generally 
responsible f or the completion of t heir f amily hist ory questionnair es and specialist ser vice 
referrals can be complet ed quickly online, which ma y help t o mitigat e some of t he 
pressur e on primar y car e ser vices. 
Not all trust s have dedicat ed familial o varian cancer multidisciplinar y teams, and t here is 
variation in practice. The committ ee not ed that similar t eams alr eady e xist f or br east 
cancer , and ha ve impr oved out comes. Alt hough t he recommendations ma y incur initial Ovarian cancer: identifying and managing f amilial and genetic risk (NG2 41)

standar dise ser vice or ganisation. The committ ee also not ed that, alt hough access t o

Recommendations 1 .2.1 to 1.2.6 and table  1 
Why the committ ee made t he recommendations 
The committ ee based t heir r ecommendations on qualitativ e evidence. 
Ther e was e vidence t hat alt hough people want inf ormation tailor ed to their individual 
situation, pr eferences and needs, t his does not alwa ys happen. In addition, people want 
information at t he most appr opriat e time, as w ell as se veral oppor tunities f or discussions. 
Ther e was also e vidence t hat inf ormation about risks can be difficult t o digest f or people 
and v aries accor ding t o each person's cir cumstances. Ther e was e vidence highlighting 
that people can f eel o verwhelmed b y the volume and comple xity of inf ormation and f eel 
that it is not alwa ys sufficient ly individualised. Ther e was also e vidence about t he 
impor tance of in volving f amilies. The committ ee agr eed t he impor tance of pr oviding 
sufficient inf ormation on an ongoing basis, tailor ed to the person's needs, so t hat people 
can mak e informed choices. 
The e vidence sho wed that rat her t han r eceiving all inf ormation at once, which can be 
overwhelming, people appr eciat e having oppor tunities t o review t heir decisions at k ey 
stages in t he pat hway. The committ ee not ed that people w ould need t o kno w ho w they 
can access ser vices t o mak e these discussions possible, and r ecommended pr oviding 
oppor tunities t o addr ess t his. 
Ther e was e vidence t hat t he considerable psy chological impact is not alwa ys sufficient ly 
addr essed, so t he committ ee recommended t hat healt hcare professionals ask people Ovarian cancer: identifying and managing f amilial and genetic risk (NG2 41)

about t heir emotional healt h and w ellbeing at each appointment. This means t hat onwar d 
referral t o genetic counselling or psy chological ser vices can be arranged if needed, f or 
example, in situations wher e there is anxiety ar ound t esting or se vere emotional distr ess. 
Ther e was e vidence t hat man y people belie ve that genetic risk only aff ects women and 
people born wit h female r eproductiv e organs. The committ ee agr eed t hat t his perpetuat es 
a lack of clarity ar ound t he risk f or men, trans w omen and non-binar y people born wit h 
male r eproductiv e organs, and discussed t he need t o raise awar eness about t he risks. 
Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, and t he equality impact assessment f or this 
guideline, t he committ ee highlight ed that some gr oups ma y need additional suppor t to 
access ser vices, f or example, b y having online rat her t han in-person appointment s. 
To emphasise t he need f or standar d information in all settings and t he cont ent of t his 
information, t he committ ee highlight ed key information t hat should be giv en to people. 
How the recommendations might aff ect pr actice 
The committ ee agr eed t hat it is curr ent practice t o provide inf ormation and suppor t but 
noted that t here is v ariation in when, what and ho w oft en it is pr ovided. The 
recommendations should lead t o greater consist ency . Although t his ma y tak e up additional 
time, it will allo w people t o bett er understand t heir risk and mak e informed choices. F or 
example, appr opriat e information and suppor t at t he right time ma y mean a person 
choosing t o have risk -reducing sur gery, which will substantially r educe t heir cancer risk 
and associat ed healt hcare cost s. Also, e xisting pr ocesses t o provide similar inf ormation 
and suppor t to those at risk of f amilial br east cancer should help lessen t he resour ce 
impact.

experience. The y discussed t hat inf ormed choices can only be made if good inf ormation is 
provided, and agr eed t hat inf ormation and suppor t is needed when people come t o 
genetics ser vices, so summarised t he inf ormation t hat should be pr ovided as a minimum. 
Evidence sho wed that, compar ed wit h usual car e, genetic counselling is associat ed wit h a 
higher uptak e of t he options being consider ed and higher scor es on a kno wledge 
questionnair e about o varian cancer risk (it could be inf erred that bett er kno wledge w ould 
lead t o a higher -quality decision). The committ ee ackno wledged t hat genetic counselling 
would not be needed b y everyone but r ecommended it f or people who meet t he referral 
criteria f or genetic t esting. 
Evidence comparing t elephone wit h face-t o-face genetic counselling sho wed no 
differences in out comes apar t from a higher uptak e of options wit h face-t o-face 
counselling. Economic e vidence also sho wed telephone counselling t o be a cost -effectiv e 
option. The committ ee not ed that t he evidence was fr om 2014 and t hat online genetic 
counselling has become a lot mor e common since t he CO VID-19 pandemic. The y agr eed 
that online or f ace-t o-face counselling should be off ered. The y also not ed that cer tain 
factors ma y influence which option is most pr eferable. F or example, f ace-t o-face 
counselling ma y be mor e appr opriat e if an int erpreter is needed, wher eas online 
counselling ma y be mor e appr opriat e if family members in a diff erent geographical location 
are att ending t he session. 
The committ ee consider ed clinical and economic e vidence t hat compar ed a gr oup session 
in which a video was sho wn bef ore individual genetic counselling sessions, wit h individual 
sessions alone. The committ ee not ed that t here were not man y clinical diff erences but 
that t here were cost sa vings associat ed wit h group sessions. The committ ee agr eed t hat a

How the recommendations might aff ect pr actice 
Genetic counselling is curr ent practice. Ho wever, the br oader eligibility crit eria f or genetic

Patient decision aids ( or aids t hat help t he healt hcare professional mak e decisions) ar e 
already used in some ser vices but t here is v ariation in practice. The r ecommendation 
would mak e decision aids mor e available in practice. Healt hcare professionals alr eady 
provide a range of appr oaches t o suppor t decision making so adapting t his to the relevant

Why the committ ee made t he recommendation 
The committ ee based t he recommendation on qualitativ e evidence and e vidence about

Ther e was e vidence t hat t here are a number of t ools wit h good per formance statistics

The e vidence sho wed that t he pr evalence of BRCA 1 and BRCA2 is higher in people fr om

Combined or al contr aceptiv es 
The committ ee agr eed, based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, t hat combined oral 
contraceptiv es can be associat ed wit h a lo wer risk of o varian cancer , but long-t erm use is 
associat ed wit h an incr ease in br east cancer . The y therefore decided t o only r ecommend 
oral contraceptiv es as a pr eventiv e medicine in par ticular cir cumstances: when t he 
reduction in o varian cancer risk (based on f or example age, f amily hist ory) ma y outw eigh 
an incr eased br east cancer risk; and aft er taking int o account whet her t he timing of risk -
reducing sur gery is appr opriat e or not (f or example, it ma y not be appr opriat e because of

In the committ ee's e xperience, people ar e not alwa ys fully inf ormed about t he pot ential 
risks (incr eased risk of de veloping br east cancer) and benefit s (reduced risk of de veloping 
ovarian cancer) of combined oral contraceptiv es, which is necessar y for inf ormed decision 
making. The y therefore recommended t hat t his should be discussed so t hat people can

Why the committ ee made t he recommendations 
The committ ee discussed general f actors t hat need t o be tak en int o account or discussed

the person w ould become unable t o become pr egnant because t heir o varies and f allopian

in people y ounger t han 35 is r elativ ely small. Based on t he evidence, t hey also specified 
the crit eria f or off ering risk -reducing sur gery. The crit eria r elate to people who ha ve a total

Recommendations 1 .8.6 to 1.8.11 and table  5 
Why the committ ee made t he recommendations 
The committ ee agr eed t hat decisions r elated to risk -reducing sur gery for ovarian cancer 
should tak e into account t he NICE guideline on f amilial br east cancer because some of t he 
genes associat ed wit h ovarian cancer w ould also incr ease t he risk of br east cancer , so 
considerations ar ound risk -reducing mast ectomy should be made in line wit h the NICE 
familial br east cancer guideline. 
The committ ee discussed t he evidence t hat bilat eral salpingo-oophor ectomy impr oves 
overall sur vival. The y not ed that most of t he evidence came fr om studies wit h carriers of 
the BRCA 1 or BRCA2 v ariant s. Based on t he evidence, t hey recommended bilat eral 
salpingo-oophor ectomy for people at incr eased risk of o varian cancer wit h BRCA 1 and 
BRCA2, and also RAD51C, RAD51D , BRIP1 or P ALB2, which ar e also associat ed wit h an 
increased risk of o varian cancer . 
The MLH1 , MSH2 or MSH6 pat hogenic v ariant s are associat ed wit h Lynch syndr ome, 
which is associat ed wit h an incr eased risk of endometrial as w ell as o varian cancer .

specific gr oup, t he committ ee decided t hat t otal h ysterectomy as w ell as bilat eral 
salpingo-oophor ectomy should be r ecommended t o prevent bot h of t hese types of 
cancers. The y not ed that PMS2 is also associat ed wit h Lynch syndr ome (and is t herefore 
on the associat ed gene panel). PMS2 incr eases t he risk of endometrial cancer alone rat her 
than endometrial as w ell as o varian cancer . The y therefore did not add it t o the table of 
risk-reducing sur gery for people at risk of o varian cancer . 
The committ ee made separat e recommendations r elated to the PMS2 pat hogenic v ariant 
because of it s link t o Lynch syndr ome. P eople wit h this pat hogenic v ariant ha ve an 
increased risk of endometrial cancer alone, but could ha ve an incr eased risk of o varian 
cancer if t here is also a f amily hist ory of o varian cancer . The y therefore consider ed it t o be 
safe to only r ecommend t otal h ysterectomy for people wit h a het erogenous PMS2 
pathogenic v ariant unless t here is also a f amily hist ory of o varian cancer when additional 
bilateral salpingo-oophor ectomy could be consider ed. 
The committ ee used t heir kno wledge and e xperience t o agr ee the minimum ages f or risk -

noted that some of t he evidence r elated to this sho wed pr omise. Ho wever, the evidence 
had v ery shor t follow-up and t herefore, the impor tant out comes such as o verall sur vival 
and o varian cancer incidence could not be measur ed. 
The committ ee not ed that MLH1 , MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 incr ease t he risk of endometrial 
cancer , and t herefore a h ysterectomy is indicat ed only f or carriers of t hese pat hogenic

How the recommendations might aff ect pr actice 
Risk-reducing sur gery is alr eady curr ent practice, but t he timing of when it is off ered 
varies. Ther e is curr ently no specific consideration f or the timing r elated to specific

The committ ee not ed that br oader eligibility crit eria f or genetic t esting will lead t o mor e

such as ser ous tubal intraepit helial car cinoma (STIC), w ould aff ect staging and ongoing

using anot her algorit hm as long as it has demonstrat ed accuracy . The committ ee 
ackno wledged t hat an infrastructur e needs t o be in place, so r ecommended t hat all

The committ ee agr eed t hat people should be made awar e that sur veillance is not an

Context 
Familial o varian cancer aff ects people born wit h female r eproductiv e organs ( ovaries, 
fallopian tubes and/or a ut erus). Alt hough in t his guideline, t he term o varian cancer is used 
throughout, t here is no w evidence t hat most high-grade ser ous cancers (t he most 
common type of o varian cancer) arise fr om t he distal f allopian tube fr om a pr ecursor lesion 
referred to as ser ous tubal intraepit helial car cinoma (STIC).

that 15% t o 20% of t hose wit h high-grade epit helial o varian cancer also carr y a pat hogenic 
variant associat ed wit h incr eased risk of o varian cancer . 
Most of t he people who carr y a pat hogenic v ariant f or ovarian cancer do not ha ve a family 
history suggestiv e of a genetic risk. This means man y people ha ve not sought t esting f or 
high-risk o varian cancer pat hogenic v ariant s. Curr ent best estimat es ar e that only 3% of 
people wit h a pat hogenic v ariant kno w that t hey are carriers. This pr opor tion will incr ease 
with impr oved availability of genetic t esting.
