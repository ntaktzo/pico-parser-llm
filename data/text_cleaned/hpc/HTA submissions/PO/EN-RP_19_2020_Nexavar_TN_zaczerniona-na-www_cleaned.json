Nevertheless, two identified publications – Worden 2015 and Brose 2016 (an\nabstract) complement the safety profile of sorafenib and update the data on overall survival collected from\nthe longer observation period of the DECISION study, on which the clinical analysis was based. The primary\nendpoint assessed in the study was PFS (progression-free survival). Findings of the study indicate an increase\nin median PFS by approx. 5 months in the SOR arm compared to the PLC arm, which was associated with a\nstatistically significant difference in favour of SOR. Overall survival (OS) was assessed as one of the secondary\nendpoints. However, no results related to median OS were presented as part of the clinical analysis. Due to\nthe fact that the trial was unblinded and sorafenib treatment was initiated in patients from the control arm\nwhen a patient progressed, statistical methods adjusting the cross-over effect were used. In line with the\nRPSFT (rank preserved structure failure time) method, higher probabilities of longer OS in the sorafenib arm\nwere observed at various time points of the analysis. However, it should be noted that this is not a result of\nthe basic analysis and it entails a certain risk of error. Therefore, drawing conclusions based on the above data\nis limited and does not allow for drawing a clear-cut conclusion regarding the efficacy of sorafenib in\ncomparison to placebo in terms of OS prolongation.

A developing nodule does not differ from benign\nnodules, therefore early diagnosis is only possible through fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Lymph node\nmetastases are more common in Hürthle cell tumours compared to FTC.\nIn some cases, the first noticeable symptom of the disease are cervical lymph nodes enlarged due to\nmetastases. In about 5% of cases, distant metastases have already occurred, and they can be the first\nsymptoms leading to the diagnosis.\nRapid growth of the nodule, its impermeability on the skin or hoarseness (a sign of infiltration of the laryngeal\nnerve) occurs at an advanced stage.\nThyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour of the endocrine glands. Its incidence is about 7.4 in\nwomen and 1.7/100,000/year in men. The onset of the disease may occur at any age, peaking between 40\nand 50 years of age. The number of thyroid cancer cases according to the KRN [National Cancer Registry] data\nfor 2015 was 3,529 patients, of which about 605 were men and 2,924 were women. Over the past two\ndecades, the number of cases has increased significantly.\nAccording to data available on orphan.net, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common thyroid\ncancer. The annual incidence of this type of cancer is 1/10,000 residents. Iodine-refractory cancer affects 2/3\nof patients with distant metastases who did not achieve a complete response during iodine therapy. This\ncondition is extremely rare and affects 4-5 patients in 1 million (about 250 people per year in France).\nThe natural course of thyroid cancer has a positive prognosis if the treatment is commenced at an early stage\n(95-98% of patients survive at least 5 years). While in most cases differentiated thyroid cancer is treatable,\nlocally advanced or metastatic cancer or cancer refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) is more resistant and is\nassociated with shorter patient survival, of up to 2.5–3.5 years. About 5-15% of patients become refractory\nto RAI therapy, 66% survive 5 years and 10% survive approx. 10 years. The prognosis for differentiated thyroid\ncancers (DTCs) is better in younger patients.\nThe growth of differentiated cancers is slow, which can lead to a false belief that the nodule is benign.\nApproximately 5% of patients are diagnosed at a late stage, in the generalised dissemination phase, when the\nprognosis is worse and despite treatment, only approx. 50% of patients survive 10 years. The formation of\nnon-iodine avid distant metastases is particularly unfavourable.",

Then, the assessment requires determining\nthe reliability of the collected data and comparing the results regarding the efficacy and safety of the new\ntherapy with those of therapies already available in a given health problem.\nBased on the above, the efficacy and safety assessment allows for obtaining information about the extent of\nthe health effect (with regard to both efficacy and safety) to be expected in relation to the new therapy\ncompared to the other considered therapeutic options.\nIt should be noted that the applicant's clinical analysis includes studies and reviews presented also in the\nframework of analysis No. AOTM-OT-4351-41/2014 of 2014, in which the use of sorafenib in differentiated\nthyroid cancers (including papillary, follicular, oxyphilic – Hürthle cell cancer) was assessed. The analysis has\nbeen updated by way of including the following systematic reviews: Yu 2019, Fleeman 2019, Donato 2018,\nYang 2017, Kawalec 2016, Gruber 2015, Blair 2015, Yang 2015, Hesselink 2015 and McFarland 2014.\nAll secondary studies were assessed using the AMSTAR 2 scale. All the included systematic reviews with a\nmeta-analysis (7/7) received a critically low rating. Of all the systematic reviews without a meta-analysis, one\nwas characterised by low quality, while the remaining ones (9/10) received a critically low rating.\nNo additional RCTs (randomized controlled trials) for sorafenib therapy published after the search of AOTM-\nOT-4351-41/2014 were identified. At the same time, the results presented in Worden 2015 and Brose 2016\nincluded in this study, respectively complement the data on the safety profile of sorafenib and update the\noverall survival data from the longer observation period of the DECISION study.\nPrimary studies:\n• DECISION (Schlumberger 2013, Brose 2014, abstract: Brose 2014a, Brose 2016, NICE 2017) – a phase\nIII multi-centre, double-blind RCT.\no Intervention and patient population:\n▪ Study arm: sorafenib (SOR) – 207 patients;\n▪ Control arm: placebo (PLC) – 210 patients.\no Analysis period: main analysis – median of 16.2 months (range: 0.03-33.2);\no The quality of the test was assessed using, among others, the Cochrane Collaboration tool:\n▪ Low risk of bias was determined in the following areas: randomisation method,\nconcealment of the randomisation code, blinding of participants and personnel,\nblinded outcome assessment and incomplete data;\n▪ Unclear risk of bias was determined in the area of selective reporting and other\nfactors.\nAccording to the applicant, the DECISION study is characterised by a low risk of bias\nin all the assessed areas. According to the Agency, blinding of investigators and\npatients is associated with a low risk of bias only in the double-blind phase. It should\nbe noted that, after the investigator diagnosed progression, the treatment was\nunblinded and patients from the placebo or sorafenib arm could receive sorafenib\nin the open phase of the study (cross-over), which could have largely influenced the\nincreased risk of bias.\nIn addition, in the Agency's opinion, due to the lack of reporting on the quality of\nlife results in the full-text publication and the fact that the DECISION study was\nsponsored by a MAH, the risk in the area of selective reporting and other factors\ncan be described as unclear.\nThe applicant also included 20 non-randomised, uncontrolled trials described in 21 publications in the review:\nAhmed 2011, Benekli 2014, Bugalho 2016, Capdevila 2012, Chrisoulidou 2015, Dadu 2014, Gallo 2015, Gupta-\nAbramson 2008, Hoftijzer 2009 (described in Hoftijzer 2009 and Schneider 2012), Jerkovich 2019, Kim 2018,\nKim 2019, Kim 2019a, Kloos 2009, Luo 2014, Marotta 2013, Marotta 2017, Massicotte 2014, Molina-Vega\n2018 and Pitoia 2014. Ahmed 2011, Gupta-Abramson 2008, Hoftijzer 2009, Schneider 2012, Kloos 2009 and\nPitoia 2014 were also included in the 2014 verification analysis. Taking into account the fact that higher-\nquality evidence which assessed the most important endpoints are available, it was decided that their results\nwould not be presented.\nAll the included studies were of moderate/good quality, scoring 3-7 points out of 8 possible on the NICE scale.\nThe following scales and questionnaires were used in the clinical analysis:\n• FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General) – the questionnaire contains questions\nconcerning the following areas: physical, family/social, emotional and functional well-being. Answers\nto the questions are given in line with the Likert scale, from 0 to 4, and the total possible score is 28.\nThe lower the score, the lower the quality of life. An increase by ≥ 4 points indicates a better response,\nwhile points from -3.99 to 3.99 indicate the same response. A decrease by 4 points or more indicates\ndeterioration;\n• EQ-5D (Euro QoL – 5 dimensions) and EQ VAS (Euro QoL visual analogue scale) – instrument for\nassessing health, designed in a way which allows it to be filled in by the patient. The descriptive EQ-\n5D concerns the following dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and\nanxiety/depression. The severity of each dimension can be assessed on a 3-point scale: 1 – no\nproblem, 2 – moderate problem, 3 – extreme problem. EQ VAS is a standard 20-centimetre, vertical\nvisual analogue scale of 0-100 (similar to a thermometer) for recording individual graphical\nassessment of a respondent concerning his/her current health-related quality of life.\nThe following parameters were used to assess efficacy:\n• HR – hazard ratio; relative likelihood of an event occurring in the study arm and the control arm at\nany time point;\n• MD – mean difference;\n• RR – relative risk; risk ratio in the study arm in relation to the risk in the control arm;\n• RD – risk difference; risk difference in the study arm and control arm;\n• NNT (Number Needed to Treat) – number of people in whom the assessed intervention should be\nused instead of the comparator to obtain an additional occurrence or to avoid the occurrence of the\ngiven event within a specified time horizon.\n• NNH (Number Needed to Harm) – number of patients in whom the use of a specific intervention for\na specific period of time is associated with the occurrence of one additional adverse endpoint or the\nabsence of one beneficial endpoint.\nIn the efficacy analysis, the following endpoints were assessed:\n• OS – overall survival;\n• PFS – progression-free survival;\n• TTP – time to progression;\n• ORR – objective response ratio;\n• CR – complete response;\n• PR – partial response;\n• SD – stable disease;\n• DCR – disease control rate.\nEfficacy",

In addition, information on\nreported aneurysm and artery dissection, which referred to sorafenib and other drugs exhibiting\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors have been found.\nNo announcements were found on the website of URPL (Polish Office for Registration of Medicinal Products,\nMedical Devices and Biocidal Products).\nLimitations\nThe most important limitation of the clinical analysis is the existence of cross-over in the DECISION study\nbetween patients in the sorafenib and placebo arms following progression observed in the placebo arm.\nTherefore, the study did not complete observation with regard to the overall survival endpoint, and thus\nmedian overall survival (OS) was not achieved.\nThe results of the OS analysis update are described in conference abstracts. However, no full-text publication\nreporting the above data is available. In addition, an OS analysis using cross-over correction methods was\nperformed as part of the exploratory analysis, which increases the uncertainty of the obtained results.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that, according to the data presented in the NICE 2017 report assessing the\nefficacy of sorafenib in the analysed population, the median value of OS was determined.\nThe reliability of the clinical analysis is affected by the following limitations:\n• Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint assessed in the DECISION study. It should be noted\nthat no conclusive data were found to confirm the relationship between the PFS results and survival\nanalysis results in the assessed population;\n• In the DECISION study, patients were allowed to use other cancer treatments following disease\nprogression, which may distort the results of the survival analysis;\n• The DECISION study protocol allowed continued use of sorafenib even after disease progression,\nwhich could have affected the results of the OS analysis. [information protected as a trade\nsecret] Therefore, in actual practice, the survival results may differ from those observed in the\nDECISION study.\nThe uncertainty of the clinical analysis is affected by the following limitations:\n• The patient population included in the DECISION study did not fully match the population included\nin the drug programme. Patients qualified for the drug programme with papillary/follicular/Hürthle\ncell thyroid carcinoma refractory to radioactive iodine constituted 57%, 8% and 18% of patients\nincluded in the study, respectively, while poorly differentiated cancer patients constituted 10% of the\nstudy population. Considering the above, it is worth noting that the results for individual\nsubpopulations are presented only in the assessment of the primary endpoint (PFS). Other results\nwere reported for the total study population;\n• DECISION contains no full-text publications reporting results on the assessment of patients' quality\nof life. The data on the quality of life was assessed as part of the exploratory analysis, and the results\nwere presented in a conference abstract (Schlumberger 2013), which affects the uncertainty of the\nobtained results.\n• Given the low share of patients with follicular thyroid cancer in the DECISION study, the obtained\nresults may not be fully representative of the population in question;\n• The objective of the DECISION study was to assess the efficacy of sorafenib in the population of\npatients with metastatic and locally advanced differentiated thyroid cancer. And yet the occurrence\nof metastatic disease was reported in 96% of patients enrolled in the study. Therefore, data on the\nefficacy of sorafenib in patients with locally advanced cancer is significantly limited;\n• [information protected as a trade secret]. At the same time, DECISION mainly included patients\nwhose ECOG performance status was 0 or 1. [information protected as a trade secret];\n• The results of the subgroup analysis, due to the lack of relevant figures reported in the DECISION\nstudy, were derived from charts. Therefore, the results may be slightly different from the original\ndata.",

      "text": "Economic analysis, including a cost-effectiveness estimation\nAn economic analysis consists in estimating and comparing the costs and health effects which may be\nassociated with the use of a new therapy in an individual patient instead of therapies which are currently\nreimbursed.\nThe costs of the therapy are estimated in the Polish currency and the health effects are usually expressed using\nthe life years gained (LYG) or the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as a result of the therapy.\nThe comparison of values concerning the costs and effects related to the use of a new therapy and comparing\nthem to the costs and effects of currently reimbursed therapies allow for obtaining an answer to the question\non whether the health effect achieved as a result of the new therapy is associated with higher costs in\ncomparison to the currently reimbursed therapies.\nThe achieved cost-effectiveness ratios are compared with the so-called cost-effectiveness threshold, i.e. which\nindicates that taking into account the means at the disposal of Poland (expressed in its GDP), the maximum\ncost of a new therapy necessary to obtain a unit of health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY), compared to the currently\navailable treatments, should not exceed three times the amount of per capita GDP.\nCurrently the cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland amounts to PLN 147,024 (3 x PLN 49,008).\nThe cost-effectiveness ratio does not estimate or determine the value of life, it only allows to assess and,\namong other things, select a therapy associated with the potentially best use of the currently available\nresources.\nAs part of the economic analysis, the applicant conducted an economic analysis in the form of a cost-utility\nanalysis (CUA) from the public payer's perspective (the National Health Fund) and from the common\nperspective (the NHF and the patient), which is comparable to the payer’s perspective in terms of the\nconditions for reimbursement proposed in the application (i.e. drug programme).\nThe economic model includes the following costs: the cost of sorafenib, the cost of drug administration,\ndiagnosis and monitoring of therapy under the proposed drug programme, the cost of routine care (BSC), the\ncost of non-drug services, and the cost of treating grade 3 and 4 adverse events for which statistically\nsignificant differences in incidence were observed. Discounting in the amount of 5% for costs and 3.5% for\nhealth effects was taken into account. A lifetime time horizon (30 years) was adopted.\nAccording to the applicant's estimates from the NHF's perspective, the use of sorafenib with BSC in BSC is\n[information protected as a trade secret]. The estimated incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) for the SOR vs\nBSC comparison was:\n• PLN/QALY [information protected as a trade secret] taking into account the risk-sharing scheme\n(RSS);\n• PLN 351,946/QALY without taking the RSS into account.\n[information protected as a trade secret] of the profitability threshold referred to in the Act on\nreimbursement (PLN 147,024/QALY).\nThe net ex-factory price per packaging unit of Nexavar, for which the cost of obtaining one quality-adjusted\nlife year (QALY) is equal to the assumed cost-effectiveness threshold (PLN 147,024), from the perspective of\nthe NHF is:\n• PLN [information protected as a trade secret] taking into account the RSS;\n• PLN [information protected as a trade secret] without taking into account the RSS;\nThe conducted deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that:\n• In the variant taking the RSS into account:\no the highest deviations to the disadvantage of sorafenib were found in the variants including\nthe alternative HR parameter value for overall survival in the BSC arm:\n▪ upon adopting the HR from the final analysis, the overall survival ICUR values were\n▪ taking into account cross-over adjustment using the IPE method – the ICUR value is\no The highest deviations in favour of the intervention in question were recorded in the\nscenarios testing the extrapolation of Kaplan-Meier curves from the DECISION study\nregarding overall survival, using alternative parametric distributions (log-normal and log-\nlogistic) – the ICUR value [information protected as a trade secret] in relation to [information\nprotected as a trade secret]\n• This variant of the analysis not taking the RSS into account:\no The highest deviations to the disadvantage of sorafenib were due to:\n▪ adopting the HR from the final survival analysis – this changes the ICUR value to PLN\n491,000/QALY\n▪ taking into account cross-over correction using the IPE method – ICUR equal to PLN\n544,000/QALY.\no Deviations from the results of the basic analysis in favour of sorafenib resulted from the\nadoption of alternative parametric curves (log-normal, log-logistic) for overall survival – ICUR\nwas PLN 190,000/QALY and PLN 195,000/QALY, respectively.\nThe conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that, at the current cost-effectiveness threshold (PLN\n147,024/QALY), the cost-effectiveness probability of sorafenib in the RSS variant is [information protected as\na trade secret] and 2% in the variant without RSS.\nLimitations of the analysis\nThe main limitation of the economic analysis is the significant uncertainty regarding the key parameter –\noverall survival – included in the economic model. The median overall survival in the DECISION study was not\nachieved and no differences between sorafenib and BSC in terms of this endpoint were found. The applicant's\nbasic analysis is based on results adjusted for cross-over (which occurred in 75% of patients in the BSC arm)\nobtained as part of post-hoc secondary survival analyses. It should also be underlined that the applicant has\nnot submitted scientific evidence showing a correlation between PFS and OS. Assuming that the applicant's\nmodel lacks differences in overall survival between the two compared arms, the intervention in question\nbecomes a technology dominated [information protected as a trade secret].\nIt should also be noted that the analyses adopted the HR value for overall survival based on an interim-\nanalysis from the cut-off point in May 2013, despite the existence of more recent data for this parameter (cut-\noff point in July 2015). The applicant explains that this approach is caused by the inability to reproduce\nsurvival curves for more recent data. However, it should be borne in mind that this parameter significantly\naffects the results of the economic analysis – testing the adoption of an updated value of this parameter as\npart of the sensitivity analysis has shown [information protected as a trade secret].\nIndication whether the circumstances referred to in Article 13, paragraph 3 of the Act of 12 May 2011 on\nthe reimbursement of drugs, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses and medical devices (Journal of Laws\nNo. 2017, item. 1844, as amended) occur;\nIn case the applicant’s clinical analysis does not include randomised clinical trials which prove the superiority\nof the drug over the medical technologies which are currently reimbursed in the particular indication, it is the\nex-factory price of the drug which must be calculated in such a way that the cost of using the drug applying\nfor reimbursement is not higher than the cost of the health technology with the most favourable ratio of\nhealth effects to the cost of obtaining them.\nGiven the fact that randomised clinical trials demonstrating the superiority of the technology in question over\nthe current practice (no treatment) have been presented, the circumstances specified in Article 13 of the Act\non reimbursement do not occur.\nAnalysis of the effects on the healthcare system, including budget impact analyses (BIA)\nThe analysis of the effects on the healthcare system consists of two important parts.\nFirstly, the analysis of the impact on the payer's budget allows for estimating potential expenditure related to\nthe financing of a new therapy from public funds.\nThe estimated expenditure related to the new therapy (the “tomorrow” scenario) is compared with how much\ncurrently is spent on the treatment of a particular health problem (the “today” scenario). On that basis it is\npossible to assess whether the new therapy will require a higher level of funding for the treatment of a\nparticular health problem or whether it will involve savings in the payer’s budget.\nThe budget impact assessment makes it possible to determine whether the payer possesses the necessary\nresources to finance a particular technology.\nThe second part of the analysis of the effects on the healthcare system raises the question on how the decision\nto finance a new therapy can affect the organisation of the provision of services (especially in the context of\nadjustments necessary for the new therapy to be used) and the availability of other healthcare services.\nAs part of the budget impact analysis, the applicant has provided the estimates of the expected expenditure\non the public payer's part in the case of adopting a positive decision on financing Nexavar (sorafenib) from\npublic funds used for the treatment of advanced, differentiated thyroid cancer, refractory to radioactive\niodine.\nThe assessment of the impact on the public payer’s budget was conducted from the NHF’s perspective in a 2-\nyear horizon. The estimated number of patients using the drug technology in question after issuing a positive\nreimbursement decision is:\n• Year 1: 150 (min. 145 – max. 154);\n• Year 2: 155 (min. 145 – max. 163).\nThe following costs were included in the analysis: the cost of sorafenib, drug administration under the\nprogramme, diagnosis and treatment monitoring, treatment of grade 3 and 4 events, routine care in the\nabsence of progression, taking the costs of BSC (pharmacotherapy and medical services) into account, routine\ncare in the case of progression, taking the costs of BSC and medical services into account, as well as palliative\nradiotherapy.\nThe introduction of financing for the technology in question will involve incremental costs from the NHF’s\nperspective in the amount of:\n• taking the proposed RSS into account:\no PLN [information protected as a trade secret] in the first year of reimbursement;\no PLN [information protected as a trade secret] in the second year of reimbursement;\n• without taking the proposed RSS into account:\no PLN 10,050,269 in the first year of reimbursement;\no PLN 21,512,156 in the second year of reimbursement;\nSensitivity analysis\nIn the minimum variant, in the event Nexavar is reimbursed and no RSS is taken into account, the public\npayer’s expenditure will increase by approx. PLN 9.7 million in the first year of reimbursement and by approx.\nPLN 20.4 million in the second year of reimbursement, and if the proposed risk-sharing scheme for Nexavar\nis taken into account, the public payer’s expenditure [information protected as a trade secret].\nIn the maximum variant, in the event Nexavar is reimbursed and no RSS is taken into account, the public\npayer’s expenditure will increase by approx. PLN 10.3 million in the first year of reimbursement and by approx.\nPLN 22.3 million in the second year of reimbursement, and if the proposed risk sharing scheme for Nexavar\nis taken into account, the public payer’s expenditure [information protected as a trade secret].\nAs part of the sensitivity analysis, the applicant has also conducted a deterministic sensitivity analysis, in\nwhich it analysed the impact of factors, such as: a change in the price of sorefanib, changes in the cost of\ndiagnostics in the drug programme, the duration of treatment determined by the PFS curve and the\nparticipation of radiation therapy in the current scenario. The conducted analysis showed that the results of\nthe budget impact analysis were stable.\nLimitations of the analysis\nThe applicant's analysis assumes that a steady number of patients from the target population in included in\nthe programme in the subsequent months. Considering the unmet needs in this population and the fact that,\ncurrently, [information protected as a trade secret] are already treated with sorafenib under the Emergency\nAccess to Drug Technologies (RDTL) procedure, the Agency recommends assuming that a significant\nproportion of patients will start sorafenib therapy in the first months following the reimbursement decision.\nThe additional limitations of the analysis are as follows:\n• The applicant's model assumes a higher overall survival of patients using sorafenib vs placebo, which\nis not confirmed by the results of the clinical analysis. Nevertheless, the above assumption has a\nmarginal impact on the public payer's part in the analysed horizon.\n• Estimates of the target population based on expert opinions are uncertain, however there are no\nreliable epidemiological data that would ensure reliable calculations, and available epidemiological\nindicators suggest that these estimates may be close to the actual values.\n• The budget impact analysis (BIA) used performance parameters and cost values estimated as part of\nthe applicant's economic analysis, therefore the limitations of these assumptions apply also to the\nBIA.\nRemarks on the proposed risk-sharing scheme\nRemarks on the drug programme records\nIn line with the content of the drug programme approved in 2014, the patient should undergo a histological\nexamination confirming the diagnosis. [information protected as a trade secret].\nReview of the solutions proposed in the rationalisation analysis\nThe objective of the rationalisation analysis is to identify a mechanism which, if introduced, will result in a\nrelease of public funds in an amount at least corresponding to the increase in costs resulting from a positive\ndecision to reimburse the intervention in question in the analysed indications.\nA rationalisation analysis is submitted if the budget impact analysis of the public payer demonstrated that\nthe cost of reimbursement would increase.\nAs part of the rationalisation analysis, the applicant proposed a solution allowing for generating savings for\nthe public payer to cover additional expenditure associated with the reimbursement of Nexavar in the\nindication in question, in the basic and maximum variant, taking the RSS into account.\nThe proposed mechanism consists of: [information protected as a trade secret].\nImplementing the solution proposed by the applicant was assessed as unlikely.\nReview of recommendations issued in other countries in relation to the technology in question\n7 clinical guidelines have been identified:\n• Jarząb 2018 – Polish;\n• European Thyroid Association (ETA) 2019 – Europe;\n• European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 – Europe;\n• National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2.2019 – United States;\n• National Cancer Institute (NCI) 2018 – United States;\n• American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 – United States;\n• Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE) 2018 – Italy.\nAll the guidelines point to sorafenib as the recommended or applicable therapy for the treatment of patients\nwith progressive, locally advanced and/or metastatic thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine. Also,\nguidelines published before 2014 (i.e. before the issuance of marketing authorisation for the drug registration\nin this indication) included in AWA AOTM-OT-4351-41/2014 (PUO 2013, NCCN 2013/2014, ESMO 2012, ATA\n2009) indicated the possibility of considering sorafenib in the treatment of metastatic, progressive\ndifferentiated thyroid cancer, refractory to radioactive iodine.\nLenvatinib, with marketing authorisation in the above indication applicable throughout the European Union\n(central procedure) is mentioned, along with sorafenib, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in first-line\ntreatment. The latest American NCCN 2.2019 guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) define\nlenvatinib as the therapy preferred over sorafenib.\n5 reimbursement recommendations for the use of Nexavar in thyroid cancer treatment have been identified:\n• Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) 2015 (France) – The organisation recommends reimbursement of\nNexavar as part of the list of drugs issued by pharmacists and used in hospitals;\n• Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) 2015 (Scotland) – Nexavar was approved for use within the\nScottish NHS in patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer\nrefractory to radioactive iodine.\n• National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 (United Kingdom) – positive\nrecommendation on the use of lenvatinib and sorafenib in the treatment of progressive, locally\nadvanced or metastatic differentiated (follicular, papillary or Hürthle cell) thyroid cancer in adult\npatients, refractory to radioactive iodine treatment, only if no treatment is applied or tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor therapy is discontinued;\n• All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) 2018 (Wales) – Recommendation in line with the NICE\n2018 recommendation;\n• pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCORD) 2015 (Canada) – The pCORD experts do not\nrecommend financing sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid\ncancer refractory to radioactive iodine.",
