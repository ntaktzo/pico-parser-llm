Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were used for\nderiving an added benefit.\nResearch question 1: patients with Child-Pugh A or no hepatic cirrhosis\nDescription of the included study 304\nThe REFLECT study (E7080-G000-304, short name 304) was used for the benefit assessment\nof lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib in the treatment of adults with HCC and Child-Pugh\nA or without hepatic cirrhosis.\nThe 304 study is an open-label RCT comparing lenvatinib with sorafenib. The study included\nadults with HCC in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C who did not receive\nany prior systemic therapy for the advanced or inoperable disease. Hepatic cirrhosis of any\naetiology was not an exclusion criterion. Patients in BCLC stage B had to be ineligible for\ntransarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Further inclusion criteria were Child-Pugh stage A\nand an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group – Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score of 0 or 1.\nOverall, 478 patients were placed in the lenvatinib arm and 476 in the sorafenib arm of the\nstudy. Randomization was stratified by the criteria of region (Asia-Pacific/Western regions),\nECOG-PS (0/1), body weight (<60 kg/≥60 kg) and the presence of macroscopic portal vein\ninvasion (MPVI) and/or extrahepatic spread (ES) (yes/no).\nThe 304 study had a total of 3 study phases: a pre-randomization phase, a randomization phase\nconsisting of a treatment phase and a follow-up phase, and an analogously designed extension\nphase.\nThe randomization phase started at the randomization time point and ended on 13 November\n2016, after a total of 700 deaths occurred in the two study arms, which corresponded to the\npredefined data cut-off for the primary outcome of overall survival. The treatment was\ncontinued until one of the following criteria was met: objectively confirmed disease\nprogression, unacceptable toxicity, participant’s decision to discontinue, revocation of consent,\nor study termination by the sponsor. In both study arms, the treatment and any dose adjustments\nwere performed in accordance with the current Summary of Product Characteristics [SPC].\nThe randomization phase was followed by an extension phase, in which patients either\ncontinued to receive the study medication in accordance with the original allocation or were\nfollowed up if treatment was discontinued during the randomization phase. In terms of their\ndesign, there was no technical difference between the randomization and extension phases. The\nextension phase is still ongoing.\nAfter discontinuation of the study medication, it was possible to administer drug and non-drug\nfollow-on therapies. There was no planned treatment switch from the control to the\nexperimental intervention. After discontinuation of the study medication, a total of 25.5% of\npatients in the lenvatinib arm and 27.3% in the sorafenib arm received a surgical or other\nmedical intervention, of which TACE was the most common at about 15% (of the total\npopulation). About 31% of patients received subsequent systemic therapy, most commonly\nsorafenib, at 25% in the lenvatinib arm and 12% in the sorafenib arm.\nThe primary outcome of the study was overall survival. Patient-relevant secondary outcomes\nwere outcomes on symptoms, health status, health-related quality of life, and adverse events\n(AEs).\nThe 304 study is still ongoing. Given its active status, data exclusively from the randomization\nphase were presented in the company’s dossier and used for the assessment.",

      "text": "Mortality\n Overall survival\nFor the outcome of overall survival, no statistically significant difference between treatment\ngroups was found. Consequently, there is no hint of an added benefit of lenvatinib in\ncomparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is therefore not proven.\nMorbidity\n Symptoms\nOutcomes on symptoms were surveyed using the symptom scales of the European Organization\nfor Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and\nthe disease-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer HCC-\nspecific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-HCC18). In both cases, time to\ndeterioration, defined as a score increase by at least 10 points over baseline, was examined.\nFor symptoms surveyed by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30, no statistically significant\ndifference between treatment groups was found for either fatigue, nausea and vomiting,\ndyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, or constipation. Consequently, for each of these outcomes,\nthere is no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is\ntherefore not proven for these outcomes.\nFor the outcome of pain, surveyed using the EORTC QLQ-C30, there is a statistically\nsignificant difference in favour of lenvatinib. However, this effect is at most marginal. For the\noutcome of pain, this results in no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with\nsorafenib.\nA statistically significant difference in favour of lenvatinib was also found for the outcome of\ndiarrhoea, for which there is an effect modification by the attribute of age. Overall, this results\nin a hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for the outcome of\ndiarrhoea in patients under 75 years of age. For patients aged 75 years or older, there is no hint\nof added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for the outcome of diarrhoea;\ntherefore, there is no proof of added benefit for this outcome in this patient group.\nRegarding the outcomes of fatigue, pain, jaundice, fever, and abdominal swelling, which were\nsurveyed using EORTC QLQ-HCC18, there were no statistically significant differences\nbetween treatment groups for the total study population. For these outcomes, this results in no\nhint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib.\n Health status\nFor health status surveyed using the European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue\nScale (EQ-5D VAS), no usable data are available. Consequently, there is no hint of added\nbenefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for the outcome of health status; an added\nbenefit is therefore not proven.\nHealth-related quality of life\nGlobal health status, the function scales of EORTC QLQ-C30, and the function scales of\nEORTC QLQ-HCC18 were used to assess health-related quality of life. In each case, time to\ndeterioration, defined as a score decrease (EORTC QLQ-C30) or score increase (EORTC QLQ-\nHCC18) by at least 10 points over baseline, was examined.\nFor health status and each of the EORTC QLQ-C30 function scales for physical, emotional,\nand social functioning, no statistically significant differences between treatment groups were\nfound. Consequently, for each of these outcomes, there is no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib\nin comparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is therefore not proven for these outcomes.\nFor the outcome of cognitive functioning, no statistically significant difference between\ntreatment groups was found in the total population. Simultaneously, this outcome exhibited a\nstatistically significant interaction with the attribute of region. Since the German health care\nsetting is better reflected by patients from Western countries, the subgroup Asia-Pacific was\nnot further examined. For patients from Western countries, there was a hint of lesser benefit of\nlenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for the outcome of cognitive functioning.\nFor role functioning, there was a statistically significant difference between groups in favour of\nlenvatinib. Given the high risk of bias at outcome level, this results in a hint of added benefit of\nlenvatinib.\nUnder the EORTC QLQ-HCC18 functional scales, statistically significant differences\nbetween treatment groups, each in favour of lenvatinib, were found for the outcomes of body\nimage and nutrition, whereas no statistically significant difference between groups was found\nfor the functional scale of sex life. Given the high risk of bias at outcome level, this results in a\nhint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for each of the outcomes of\nbody image and nutrition. For the outcome of sex life, there is no hint of added benefit of\nlenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is therefore not proven for this\noutcome.\nAdverse events\n Serious AEs (SAEs)\nFor the outcome of SAEs, a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 with a considerable reduction in median\ntime to event under lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib (13.5 months under lenvatinib\nversus 23.3 months under sorafenib) was found, but this difference is not statistically\nsignificant. Consequently, there is no hint of greater or lesser harm of lenvatinib in comparison\nwith sorafenib; greater or lesser harm is therefore not proven.\n Severe AEs (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≥ 3)\nFor the outcome of severe AEs (CTCAE grade ≥ 3), there was no statistically significant\ndifference between treatment groups. Consequently, there is no hint of greater or lesser harm\nof lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; greater or lesser harm is therefore not proven.\n Discontinuation due to AEs\nFor the outcome of discontinuation due to AEs, no statistically significant difference between\ntreatment groups was found. Consequently, there is no hint of greater or lesser harm of\nlenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; greater or lesser harm is therefore not proven.\n Specific AEs\nFor the selection and assessment of specific AEs, no usable data were available. In Module 4 B,\nthe company also included event time analyses for a selection of severe AEs of grade 3 or 4 on\nthe level of preferred terms (PTs) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities\n(MedDRA), but these were incomplete. Suitable event time analyses for common AEs and\nSAEs were completely missing.\nResearch question 2: patients with Child-Pugh B\nNo data are available for the assessment of lenvatinib in patients with Child-Pugh B. In its\ndossier, the company did not differentiate between research questions 1 and 2 but searched\ngenerally for studies comparing lenvatinib with sorafenib in systemic treatment-naïve adults\nwith advanced or inoperable HCC. The Institute’s information retrieval did not find any relevant\nstudy for research question 2.\nProbability and extent of added benefit, patient groups with therapeutically important\nadded benefit3\nOn the basis of the results presented, the probability and extent of the added benefit of the drug\nlenvatinib compared with the ACT is assessed as follows:\nFor research question 1, the final results analysis from the 304 study, in part on the subgroup\nlevel, revealed both positive and negative effects of lenvatinib.\nOn the positive effects side, there was a hint of minor added benefit of lenvatinib for individual\ndimensions of health-related quality of life (role functioning, body image, and nutrition). A\npositive effect of a greater extent (considerable) was found for the outcome of diarrhoea in\npatients < 75 years of age. By contrast, there was a hint of lesser benefit for the cognitive\nfunctioning dimension of health-related quality of life.\nFurthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs.\nIn this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change\nmaterially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also\nreveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately\nweigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit\nof lenvatinib is therefore not proven.\nNo relevant study was found for research question 2. An added benefit of lenvatinib is\ntherefore not proven for this research question.\nTable 3 presents a summary of the probability and extent of the added benefit of lenvatinib.\n3 On the basis of the scientific data analysed, IQWiG draws conclusions on the (added) benefit or harm of an\nintervention for each patient-relevant outcome. Depending on the number of studies analysed, the certainty of\ntheir results, and the direction and statistical significance of treatment effects, conclusions on the probability of\n(added) benefit or harm are graded into 4 categories: (1) “proof”, (2) “indication”, (3) “hint”, or (4) none of the\nfirst 3 categories applies (i.e., no data available or conclusions 1 to 3 cannot be drawn from the available data).\nThe extent of added benefit or harm is graded into 3 categories: (1) major, (2) considerable, (3) minor (in\naddition, 3 further categories may apply: non-quantifiable extent of added benefit, added benefit not proven, or\nless benefit). For further details see [1,2].\nTable 3: Lenvatinib – probability and extent of added benefit\nResearch Indicationa ACT b Probability and extent of\nquestion added benefit\n1 Adult patients with advanced or inoperable Sorafenib Added benefit not provend\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have\nnot yet received systemic therapy:\n with Child-Pugh A or no hepatic cirrhosis\n2 Adult patients with advanced or inoperable BSCc Added benefit not proven\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have\nnot yet received systemic therapy:\n with Child-Pugh B\na: For this therapeutic indication, it is assumed that neither curative treatment (for BLCL stages 0 and A) nor\nlocoregional therapy in BLCL stage B, particularly transarterial (chemo)embolization (TACE or TAE), is an\noption (any longer).
