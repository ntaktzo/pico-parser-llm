This\nappraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of the published\nNICE technology appraisal guidance on sorafenib for treating advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma.\n3.2 The company's original submission presented clinical effectiveness data\nfrom the SHARP study. SHARP was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled, randomised trial in patients with advanced hepatocellular\ncarcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment. The study\nincluded 602 patients and assessed the effect of sorafenib plus best\nsupportive care (n=299) compared with placebo plus best supportive\ncare (n=303).

      "text": "4.1 The appraisal committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and\ncost effectiveness of sorafenib, having considered evidence on the\nnature of hepatocellular carcinoma and the value placed on the benefits\nof sorafenib by people with the condition, those who represent them,\nand clinical experts. It also took into account the effective use of NHS\nresources.\n4.2 The committee considered the UK treatment pathway for patients with\nhepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical experts described that in UK\nclinical practice one third of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\nwould be eligible for procedures such as local resection, radiofrequency\nablation or chemoembolisation. They noted that these procedures are\nnot considered clinically effective for approximately 50% of patients, wh\nwould progress to further locoregional therapy or systemic treatment.\nThe committee accepted that the scope of this technology appraisal w\nrestricted to these patients. The committee further reviewed the\ntreatment pathway consistent with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer\n(BCLC) staging classification and treatment schedule as presented by\nLlovet et al. (2008). The clinical experts agreed that the BCLC staging\nsystem is used in UK clinical practice.\n4.3 The committee was aware that the licensed indication for sorafenib is\nhepatocellular carcinoma without specific restrictions. However, the\nclinical effectiveness evidence from the SHARP study was for patients\nwith advanced hepatocellular carcinoma when surgical or locoregional\ntherapies had failed or were not suitable. This population was consisten\nwith UK clinical practice and clinical guidelines as outlined in the\ncompany's decision problem. The committee noted that the company\npresented evidence from SHARP in which patients had predominantly\nBCLC stage C (that is, advanced stage) disease (82.4%). They also had\npredominantly good liver function (that is, Child-Pugh grade A liver\nfunction; 96.5%), and good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG\nperformance status (0 to 2). The committee considered how the clinica\neffectiveness evidence from SHARP related to the total UK population\nwith advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly for patients with\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights\nd\ns\ny\nho\nwas\nnt\nd\nG)\nal\nand-\ne 8 of\nChild-Pugh grade B liver function. The committee heard from the clinical\nexperts that systemic therapy with sorafenib would be considered for\npatients with Child-Pugh grade B liver function although this type of\ntherapy may be less clinically effective than for patients with Child-Pugh\ngrade A liver function. The committee accepted that patients with\nadvanced hepatocellular carcinoma with either Child-Pugh grade A or B\nliver function may benefit from systemic therapy, although not\nnecessarily to the same degree. The committee accepted that the\ncompany's decision problem focused on advanced hepatocellular\ncarcinoma and was in accordance with the scope.\n4.4 The committee then discussed possible comparators used in the UK for\nadvanced hepatocellular carcinoma in clinical practice. The committee\naccepted that in UK clinical practice, treatment with conventional\nchemotherapy (such as doxorubicin) would be recommended only for a\nminority of patients who are able to tolerate it. The committee noted that\nusual treatment for patients with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma\n(defined as asymptomatic tumours without vascular invasion or hepatic\nspread) is transarterial chemoembolisation, in line with current clinical\nguidelines. The committee was aware that this subgroup was outside the\ndecision problem presented by the company. Therefore best supportive\ncare was accepted as an appropriate comparator for most patients with\nadvanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\nClinical effectiveness (NICE technology apprais\nguidance 189)\n4.5 The committee considered the clinical effectiveness data presented by\nthe company. It noted that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib\nplus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by\nmore than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care.\nThe committee also noted that there was a statistically significant\ndifference in median time to radiological disease progression for patients\nin the sorafenib group compared with the placebo group. The committee\nwas aware that there was an extension in time to disease progression of\n11.7 weeks according to independent assessment or 5.1 weeks according\nto investigator assessment, compared with placebo. The committee\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights\nsal\ne 9 of\naccepted the evidence from SHARP, but was aware that the study was\nstopped early, potentially underestimating the survival benefit\nattributable to sorafenib. The committee heard from clinical experts and\npatient experts that the observed benefits in overall survival and time t\nradiological disease progression were clinically meaningful. It noted tha\na statistically significant difference was not seen for time to symptomat\ndisease progression for sorafenib compared with placebo. However, the\ncommittee accepted the company's and evidence review group's (ERG'\nview that the questionnaire used to measure time to symptomatic\ndisease progression (FHSI-8) may not have been able to distinguish\nbetween the toxicity of sorafenib, symptoms of the underlying liver\ndisease, and the symptoms of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\n4.6 The committee heard from a patient expert that severe adverse events\n(such as diarrhoea and hand-foot skin reaction) had been experienced\nduring 15 months of treatment with sorafenib, and occasionally it was\nnecessary to stop treatment temporarily. The clinical experts confirmed\nthat similar adverse events have been seen in clinical practice, but no\npatients in their experience had completely stopped treatment with\nsorafenib for this reason. The patient experts agreed that although the\nadverse events experienced were unpredictable and affected health-\nrelated quality of life, they could be tolerated because of the benefits in\nterms of extension to life.\n4.7 Based on the clinical effectiveness evidence and the testimony from\nclinical experts and patient experts, the committee concluded that\nsorafenib is a clinically effective treatment for advanced hepatocellular\ncarcinoma when surgical or locoregional therapy had failed or was not\nsuitable.\nCost effectiveness (NICE technology appraisa\nguidance 189)\n4.8 The committee discussed the cost effectiveness of sorafenib for patien\nwith advanced hepatocellular carcinoma when surgical or locoregional\ntherapies had failed or were not suitable. The committee noted that the\nbase-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented by the\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

When the patient access scheme was included this went down\n£51,900 per QALY gained. Both ICERs were substantially higher than\nthose normally considered to be an acceptable use of NHS resources.\n4.9 The committee noted that the ICER presented in the company's base\ncase depended on the extrapolation of overall survival beyond the\nSHARP study timeframe by fitting a log normal probability distribution.\nSeveral alternative probability distributions were considered and fitted\nthe data well, and the committee was aware that although the log norm\ncurve provided a slightly better fit, particularly for the early trial data,\nalternatives also fitted the data well. The main differences were in the\nshape of the curves at the tail of the distribution where, for example, a\nWeibull curve with a heavier tail was a good fit. The committee\nconcluded that, although the log normal curve provided a slightly bette\nfit to the observed data, it could not be accepted as the definitive\nfunction to extrapolate beyond the study data. The Weibull distribution,\nwhich also provided an acceptable fit, should also be considered in any\nconsideration of uncertainty. The base-case log normal extrapolation\nproduced an ICER for sorafenib of £51,900 per QALY gained, which was\nat the lowest end of the range. The Weibull extrapolation of survival dat\nproduced an ICER that was substantially higher (commercial in\nconfidence) than the log normal base case.\n4.10 The committee then discussed the ERG's critique of the company's\npatient access scheme submission. The committee noted concerns\nabout the discrepancies in the dosage of sorafenib and the length of\ntime a pack would last between the patient access scheme as modelled\nand as described in the summary of product characteristics. It agreed\nthat the description in the summary of product characteristics did not\naccount for dose reductions or stopping treatment temporarily, and tha\nthe treatment intensity modelled in the company's submission (based o\nSHARP) was more appropriate. The committee considered that the cos\nof post-progression sorafenib treatment was removed from the model\nbut that the benefits were not adjusted. It agreed that, because in clinic\npractice the benefit from post-progression treatment is likely to be sma\nretaining the benefits in the model would have a minimal effect on the\nICER.\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights\nto\nmal\ner\ny\ns\nta\nd\nat\non\nst\ncal\nall,\nand- P\n4.11 The committee also noted the inconsistencies in costs associated with\ntreatment duration and agreed that the treatment costs should be base\non the actual length of the model cycle. This increased the ICER derived\nusing the log normal extrapolation from £51,900 to £52,600 per QALY\ngained. It also increased the corresponding (commercial in confidence)\nICER using the Weibull extrapolation of survival data. The committee als\nnoted that the company's model did not take into account the\nadministration costs to the NHS of the patient access scheme but\nconcluded that this would only increase the ICERs marginally.\n4.12 The committee was aware of the concerns raised by the ERG about\ninconsistencies in the utilities used in the company's model. However, it\nnoted that when alternative utility values from a previous renal cell\ncarcinoma assessment report (used to develop NICE's technology\nappraisal guidance on sunitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced\nand/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and bevacizumab [first-line],\nsorafenib [first- and second-line], sunitinib [second-line] and\ntemsirolimus [first-line] for the treatment of advanced and/or metastati\nrenal cell carcinoma) were used in a sensitivity analysis, the log normal\nbase-case ICER was not significantly affected.\n4.13 The committee considered the additional work by the ERG on the\nindependent and investigator assessments of time to radiological\ndisease progression. It noted that the ICER presented in the company's\nbase case depended on investigator assessment (rather than\nindependent assessment, which was the primary analysis in SHARP). T\ncommittee noted that the ERG's analyses demonstrated that the origina\nlog normal base case increased to £76,000 per QALY gained (not\nincluding the patient access scheme) when using the independent\nassessment of time to radiological disease progression. The\ncorresponding (commercial in confidence) ICER derived using the Weib\nextrapolation of survival data would also be substantially higher.\nTherefore it concluded that sorafenib, as a treatment for advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma when surgical or locoregional therapies had\nfailed or were not suitable, would not be a cost-effective use of NHS\nresources.\n4.14 The committee then considered supplementary advice from NICE that\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights\ned\nd\nso\nt\nic\ns\nThe\nal\nbull\nand- P\nshould be taken into account when appraising treatments that may\nextend the life of patients with a short life expectancy and that are\nlicensed for indications that affect small numbers of people with\nincurable illnesses. For this advice to be applied, all the following criteria\nmust be met:\n• The treatment is indicated for patients with a short life expectancy, normally\nless than 24 months.\n• There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the treatment offers an extension\nto life, normally of at least an additional 3 months, compared with current NHS\ntreatment.\n• The treatment is licensed or otherwise indicated for small patient populations.\nIn addition, when taking these criteria into account, the committee must be\npersuaded that the estimates of the extension to life are robust and that the\nassumptions used in the reference case economic modelling are plausible,\nobjective and robust.\n4.15 The committee discussed whether the benefit provided by sorafenib in\nhepatocellular carcinoma fulfilled the criteria for consideration as a life-\nextending, end-of-life treatment. It noted from the clinical studies that\nlife expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than\n24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter\nwas based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee\nconsidered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best\nsupportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more\nthan 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and\nthe company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival\nof 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.\nAlthough the committee noted that sorafenib is licensed for indications\nother than hepatocellular carcinoma, the committee considered sorafenib\nto fulfil the small population criterion for an end-of life treatment. In\nsummary, the committee was satisfied that sorafenib for advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma met the criteria for an appraisal of a life-\nextending, end-of-life treatment, and that the evidence presented was\nsupported by robust data.\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 13 of\n4.16 The committee then discussed the range of cost-effectiveness estimates\nfor sorafenib (with the lowest being the ICER of £52,600 per QALY\ngained and the highest being substantially greater), in light of the end-\nof-life considerations. It considered that the magnitude of additional\nweight that would need to be assigned to the original QALY benefits in\nthis patient group for the cost effectiveness of the drug to fall within the\ncurrent threshold range would be too great. Therefore the committee\nconcluded that sorafenib as a treatment for advanced hepatocellular\ncarcinoma when surgical or locoregional therapies had failed or were not\nsuitable would not be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n4.17 The committee considered whether there were any subgroups of people\nfor whom sorafenib would be considered a cost-effective use of NHS\nresources. The committee noted that the subgroups presented by the\ncompany were based on a small number of patients, and because the\nclinical study was not powered to assess differential patient response to\ntreatment, the subgroups were intended to be descriptive only. Also, no\nadjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The committee was\naware that there was limited evidence of clinical effectiveness in these\nsubgroups and that the ICERs would be based on a weak evidence base.\nTherefore the committee was not satisfied that the estimates of\nextension to life were robust or that the resulting subgroup ICERs were\nplausible. It concluded that it would not be appropriate to recommend\nsorafenib for specific subgroups of patients with advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma.\nCancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of NICE\ntechnology appraisal guidance 189\n4.18 This appraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of the published\nNICE technology appraisal guidance on sorafenib for the treatment of\nadvanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

The committee\nnoted consultation comments from professional groups that suggested\nsorafenib may be more clinically effective in people with Child-Pugh\ngrade A liver function and good performance status. It was aware that\nresults from the King et al. study showed median overall survival in\npeople with Child-Pugh grade A liver function was 9.5 months, compared\nwith 4.6 months in people with Child-Pugh grade B liver function and that\nthe Gideon study demonstrated median overall survival of 6.2 months in\npeople with Child-Pugh grade B7 liver function.

Subject to Notice of rights  P\ndicine\nes\n4.23 The committee discussed the 3 longitudinal observational studies;\nPalmer et al., GIDEON and King et al. It recognised that Palmer et al. was\na published retrospective cohort study comparing patients with\nhepatocellular carcinoma in 2 hepatobiliary oncology units in the UK who\neither received funding for sorafenib (n=57) or did not receive funding\n(n=76) before the existence of the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee\nheard from the company that the decision to fund sorafenib was not\nbased on clinical variables. The committee was aware that there was a\nhigher proportion of patients with metastatic disease in the unfunded\ngroup. The committee noted that patients who did not receive funding\nfor sorafenib did not live as long as patients who did have funding. It also\nconsidered that the association between funding and death may be\nconfounded, that is, patients with better prognoses might be more likely\nto receive funding and treatment than patients with poorer prognoses. It\nnoted the ERG's comment that the study was not suitable for decision-\nmaking. However, the committee could not exclude the possibility of\nresidual confounding and concluded that the data from Palmer were a\nless robust source of evidence than the GIDEON data, now matched to\nSHARP. It further noted that the parametric curves to extrapolate overall\nsurvival using the Palmer data did not favour a log normal or Weibull\ndistribution over the other. The committee then discussed the King et al.\naudit of mainly Cancer Drugs Fund patients in England, noting that it\ndescribes the experience of 448 people with hepatocellular carcinoma\nwho had sorafenib. However, the committee noted that the population\ndid not match that of SHARP because of the higher proportion of\npatients with Child-Pugh B liver function in King et al. The committee\nconcluded that the matched GIDEON data were more appropriate than\nPalmer or King et al. for validating the extrapolation of overall survival\nbeyond SHARP.\n4.24 The committee discussed the GIDEON data, noting that the company\nresponded to the appraisal consultation document by adjusting the data\nto match the characteristics of the SHARP population, particularly for risk\nfactors for death. The company chose a propensity score, a method of\nstatistical matching, to do this for baseline characteristics reported\nacross both SHARP and GIDEON. The committee recognised that the\nERG considered this statistical approach satisfactory but some baseline\ncharacteristics likely to affect the risk of death (such as viral hepatitis)\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\ncould not be matched because of a lack of reporting. The committee also\nnoted that the matched GIDEON sample (n=895) resulted in longer\nmedian overall survival than SHARP. The committee noted that this\nlonger median overall survival was associated with a shorter mean\ntreatment duration and dosage compared with SHARP. The committee\nconsidered this relationship seemed counterintuitive (that is, it would\nhave expected a shorter treatment duration and dosage to result in a\nshorter overall survival), and considered that there may be residual\nconfounding. It concluded that there was some uncertainty around the\ncomparability of the matched GIDEON population and the SHARP\npopulation.\n4.25 The committee then considered the most appropriate parametric curve\nto extrapolate overall survival in SHARP to fit the matched GIDEON data,\nwhich provided a longer period of follow-up. The company fitted log\nnormal and Weibull curves to the Kaplan–Meier data for the matched\nGIDEON population and stated that the log normal curve provided a\nbetter statistical fit to the observed data than the Weibull curve; the\ncommittee agreed with this based on standard statistical criteria using\nthe Bayesian information criterion described in Kass et al. (1995). The\ncommittee considered that beyond about 600 days, the Weibull curve\nfitted the data better than the log normal curve. However, the committee\nwas aware that the uncertainty was greater in the tail of the curve where\nlimited or no data existed. The committee understood from the ERG that\nthe log normal function would overestimate overall survival whereas the\nWeibull function would underestimate it. Therefore, the ERG advised that\nboth curves should be considered when extrapolating overall survival,\nand to estimate the ICER for sorafenib compared with best supportive\ncare. The committee acknowledged that it would not use statistical\ngoodness of fit alone to choose the most appropriate survival function. It\nnoted that in general the log normal function used by the company to\nextrapolate survival beyond SHARP fitted GIDEON better than the Weibull\nfunction, but that the Weibull function was still plausible. The committee\nwas also aware that the 3 data sets the company had presented (SHARP,\nGIDEON, and Palmer et al.) for informing the choice of survival\ndistribution did not conclusively favour 1 single distribution. For example,\nthe Bayesian information criterion statistics provided evidence that the\nlog normal function fitted the data better than the Weibull function in the\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\nSHARP analysis based on Kass et al., but this was not considered a\nstatistically strong difference and therefore the committee considered\nthat the Weibull function remained plausible. The committee reiterated\nthat SHARP was among the most robust source of evidence it had seen\nfor sorafenib during the Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration committee\nmeetings. Therefore, the committee concluded that the true estimate o\nlife expectancy with sorafenib compared with best supportive care was\nlikely to lie between the estimates from the log normal and the Weibull\ndistributions, but agreed it was closer to the log normal estimates than\nthe Weibull estimates.",

At its first and second meetings, the committee\nagreed that the effectiveness and costs should ideally come from the\nsame study; this approach was supported by the ERG and by NHS\nEngland. The committee noted that in King et al. people with Child-Pug\ngrade A liver function did not live as long as people in SHARP\n(9.5 months compared with 10.7 months). The committee considered\nthat this may have been partly explained by the reduction in treatment\nduration (3.6 months in King et al. compared with 5.3 months in SHARP\nand daily dose (590 mg in King et al. compared with 711 mg in SHARP)\nbetween the studies. The committee was also aware that people with\nChild-Pugh grade A liver function in GIDEON had a median overall\nsurvival of 13.6 months and a median treatment duration of 4.1 months,\nwhich the committee stated seemed counterintuitive when compared\nwith King et al. and SHARP. The committee appreciated that clinical\nexperience with sorafenib had improved over time and adverse events\nmay now be managed better, partly by shorter duration of treatment. T\ncommittee heard from NHS England that patients now have treatment f\na shorter period of time than was standard in 2007, trading a sizeable\ndecrease in adverse events for a small drop in effectiveness. But taking\nall the observational evidence into account, the committee noted it had\nconcerns about the generalisability of these results to the SHARP\nrandomised controlled trial. The committee discussed the company's\nanalysis of the individual patient level data on the time to treatment\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights\nn\ne\ns\ne\ngh\nP)\nThe\nfor\ng\nd\nand- P\ndiscontinuation from the matched GIDEON analysis. The committee\nunderstood from the company that everyone in GIDEON stopped\ntreatment so the company provided only an unrestricted mean and a\nKaplan–Meier analysis (rather than a parametric model). But the\ncommittee highlighted that it would have preferred the company to also\nfit parametric curves to the data because of the differences in the\nGIDEON and SHARP populations, and the small number of events\ntowards the end of the Kaplan–Meier curves of time to treatment\ndiscontinuation, which leads to uncertainty. The committee concluded\nthat data from SHARP should be used to estimate duration of treatmen\nand the total cost of treatment.\n4.27 The committee discussed at its first 2 meetings which data from SHARP\nbest reflected the duration of treatment. It understood that the compan\nand the ERG preferred different methods; the company preferred time t\ndisease progression as a proxy for duration of treatment, whereas the\nERG and the committee preferred the actual data on duration of\ntreatment. The committee acknowledged the debate in the original\nappraisal about using either investigator assessment or independent\nassessment of disease progression as a surrogate for time on treatmen\nThe company continued to use time to disease progression for treatme\nduration in its base-case analysis despite the committee's stated\npreference in the appraisal consultation document. This was because th\ncompany considered that the treatment duration in SHARP was longer\nthan seen in UK clinical practice. The committee understood that the\nERG considered that the estimates of mean and median treatment\nduration reported by the Cancer Drugs Fund, King et al., GIDEON and\nPalmer et al. were inconclusive and therefore did not support the\ncompany's claim that SHARP overestimated the treatment duration of\nsorafenib in clinical practice. The ERG noted that time to progression\nbased on independent assessment (the primary means of assessment\nthe SHARP protocol) and treatment duration were similar and also note\nthe committee's preference in the original appraisal for including\ntreatment costs for patients who had treatment after progression. The\ncommittee concluded that treatment duration estimates should be base\non data directly reflecting the time on treatment.\n4.28 The committee discussed the company's methods for extrapolating tim\n© NICE 2024.

The company presented a survival\nanalysis of the time from the date of randomisation to the date of\ndiscontinuation of treatment from any cause. To extrapolate beyond the\nend of the trial, the company applied 5 parametric models: exponential,\nGompertz, log logistic, log normal and Weibull, plus a hybrid analysis that\nthe company considered the most robust. The committee understood\nthat the ERG preferred the fully parametric log normal model because a\nhybrid approach was only appropriate when there was a strong rationale\nfor not using all of the available data to inform the extrapolated curve.\nThe committee stated that the log normal distribution was the best\nstatistical fit of the 5 distributions explored by the company. The\ncommittee noted that based on the Kass et al. criteria, the Bayesian\ninformation criterion statistics strongly indicated that the log normal\ndistribution was a better fit to the observed data than the Weibull. The\ncommittee also heard from the clinical expert that approximately 10% of\npatients are still having sorafenib treatment at 3 years, which supported\nusing the log normal distribution. The committee concluded that the\ncompany's fully parametric method using the log normal distribution was\nthe most robust estimate of treatment duration.",

It was also aware that in clinical\npractice, the company charges the NHS for a full pack of sorafenib at the\nstart of each treatment cycle. Some patients do not complete the\ntreatment cycle. Therefore the company may have underestimated the\ncost of treatment in its economic modelling for the first reconsideration\nmeeting. In its response to the appraisal consultation document, the\ncompany presented cost-effectiveness results for analyses including the\nwastage of up to 7 days of treatment. The committee concluded that it\nwas appropriate for the company to use updated unit cost data and\naccount for 7 days of drug wastage because this reflected the price\nrelevant to the NHS.\n4.30 The committee was aware that in the original appraisal the company\nbased its estimates of resource use, for example, number of\nhospitalisations, on the opinion of 4 clinicians.

In its response to the appraisal\nconsultation document, the company claimed that resource estimates\nfrom the original appraisal were no longer accurate because of\nsignificant changes in clinical practice. Specifically, patients now had\ntreatment in oncology rather than hepatology clinics and had palliative\ncare in the community. The committee noted that the company did not\nprovide any more evidence in its response to the appraisal consultation\ndocument. The committee heard from the ERG that the parameters\naffecting the ICER most when using the updated resource use estimate\ncompared with the pooled resource use estimates were in the best\nsupportive care group, particularly those for admission and frequency o\nhospitalisation. Also, the committee understood from the ERG that the\nICER was extremely sensitive to changes in these parameters.

The\ncommittee agreed that the most plausible ICER should:\n• be based on the ERG's exploratory analyses using the company's fully\nparametric method (log normal distribution) to estimate treatment duration\n(see section 4.28)\n• account for drug wastage for up to 7 days and\n• use the pooled resource use data in the absence of more robust updated\nresource use data.\nThe committee was aware that after its third meeting the company proposed a\nnew commercial access agreement to NHS England, and the committee was\naware of the revised estimates of cost effectiveness. The committee\nappreciated that the most plausible ICER was below £50,000 per QALY gained\nfor sorafenib compared with best supportive care (based on the ERG's\nweighted average results; 75% log normal and 25% Weibull distribution to\nextrapolate overall survival), including the new Commercial Medicines Unit\nprice and the commercial access agreement (the details of the commercial\naccess agreement are confidential and therefore cannot be published).
