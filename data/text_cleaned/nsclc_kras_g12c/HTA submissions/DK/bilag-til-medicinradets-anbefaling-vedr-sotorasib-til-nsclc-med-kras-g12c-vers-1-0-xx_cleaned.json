En innovation der anerkendes af EMA, der\ntilkendte Sotorasib en konditionel marketingsautorisation grundet det betydelige unmet need som Sotorasib\nadresserer. Vi er derfor overordnet tilfredse med at medicinrådet vurderer, at de anvendte studier afspejler\ndansk klinisk praksis, samt at de anvendte metoder muliggør en sundhedsøkonomisk evaluering.\nDer er dog forhold i denne vurderingsrapport, som Amgen ønsker at benytte muligheden for at kommentere\npå:",

      "text": "Det er uklart hvorfor medicinrådssekretariatet ikke har inkluderet en gennemgang af uønskede bivirkninger i\nforbindelse med vurderingen af Sotorasib. Dette på trods af, at sammenlignende tabeller over disse var\nudarbejdet og vedlagt ansøgningsmaterialet, samt at det er muligt at inkludere disse i den\nsundhedsøkonomiske model. I denne konkrete sag er det vanskeligt at vurdere om uønskede hændelser\nforårsages af Sotorasib i Codebreak 100, eller om de forårsages af tidligere behandlingslinjer, hvilket også\nkommenteres i rapporten. Det kunne have været yderligere belyst, hvis der også var taget stilling til uønskede\nbivirkninger.\nSotorasib forårsager færre uønskede bivirkninger af grad 3+ i Codebreak 100 (20,6%) sammenlignet med\nDocetaxel i SELECT-1 (30%) på trods af, at patienter i Codebreak 100 var på aktiv behandling i mere end\ndobbelt så lang tid som i SELECT-1, havde modtaget flere tidligere behandlingslinjer, og patienter i SELECT-1\nhar bedre performance score end patienterne i Codebreak 100. Vi er opmærksomme på, at en sammenligning\naf uønskede bivirkninger kan introducere en vis bias, da dette er investigatorbedømt, men i denne konkrete\nsag vil det nuancere vurderingen yderligere.\n2. Medicinrådssekretariatet påkræves ikke den samme grad og konsistens i argumentationen\nfor tilvalg, fravalg og ændringer i hovedanalysen, som der påkræves ansøgende\nvirksomhed.\nUnder valideringen af virksomheders indsendte ansøgninger rejses der krav om dokumentation og/eller, som\nminimum, fuldstændig entydig argumentation for alle valg og antagelser foretaget i forbindelse med indholdet\naf ansøgningen. Dette er en praksis vi selvfølgelig bifalder og til fulde anerkender nødvendigheden af.\nDer forekommer dog ikke at være anlagt samme praksis i sekretariatets vurdering, hvilket vi gerne vil illustrere\nved følgende eksempler:",

      "text": "Herunder findes citater fra medicinrådet i denne konkrete sag, hvor vi vurderer at argumentationen ikke er\nkonsistent i rapporten.\n”Medicinrådet vurderer, baseret på klinisk erfaring, at ansøgers valgte ekstrapolering for docetaxel er for\noptimistisk, da det er usandsynligt, at ca. 4 % af patienterne forsat er i live ved docetaxelbehandling efter 5 år.\nDerfor ændrer Medicinrådet ekstrapoleringen af OS for docetaxel til eksponentiel fordeling, se den orange\nkurve i Figur 4. Dette skyldes, at den eksponentielle fordeling har det bedste statistiske fit (jf. AIC/BIC) af de tre\nfordelinger (Weibull, Gompertz og eksponentiel), der vurderes at være klinisk plausible. Medicinrådet\nekstrapolerer ligeledes OS for sotorasib med eksponentiel fordeling, da der ikke er kliniske argumenter for, at\nden parametriske fordeling bør variere mellem de to behandlingsarme.”\nPublic\nTidligere i ansøgningen har medicinrådet fremført følgende argument baseret på det danske lungecancer\nregister:\n”Femårsoverlevelsen for den samlede patientgruppe med uhelbredelig NSCLC er 2-3 % (patienter diagnosticeret\ni 2015)”\nSiden 2015 er IO behandling rykket i første linje for hele patientpopulationen, hvilket med rimelighed kan\nantages at forbedre femårsoverlevelsen fremover. Medicinrådssekretariatet vælger altså at reducere\noverlevelsen for begge behandlingsarme betragteligt på baggrund af en usikkerhed vedrørende 1% i\nkomparatorarmen. Dette underbygges i nogen grad af årsrapporten fra DLCG 2021, hvor der ses en markant\nøgning af 5 årsoverlevelsen for patienter fra 2016 sammenlignet med 20151 (fra 3.7-5.3), dette indikere en\nbetydelige forbedring i overlevelse på området.",

      "text": "”Medicinrådet accepterer ansøgers antagelser vedrørende administrations- og testomkostninger for sotorasib.\nDerimod anvender ansøger en DRG-takst for intravenøs administration af docetaxel, som inkluderer\nlægemiddelprisen på docetaxel, hvilket betyder, at ansøger tæller lægemiddelomkostningerne for docetaxel\ndobbelt (enhedsomkostning på 17.556). Medicinrådet ændrer derfor administrationsomkostningerne for\ndocetaxel til et administrationsbesøg. Hertil anvendes enhedsomkostningen på 2.180 DKK, svarende til 2022\nDRG-taksten (04MA98) MDC04 1-dagsgruppe, pat. mindst 7 år), jf. Interaktiv DRG med diagnosekode: ’Kræft i\nlunge og procedurekode: Medicingivning med intravenøs injektion’.\nUden at forholde sig til om den nævnte takst over- eller underestimerer ressourceforbruget ifbm. behandling\nmed docetaxel, kan det da retfærdiggøres at reducere en takst med +15.000 kr på baggrund af at taksten\nskulle inkludere et lægemiddel der koster 150 kr per dosis?\nHvis medicinrådet er usikre på risikoen for dobbelttælling, som det beskrives her, så burde løsningen, på\nbaggrund af denne argumentation, være at reducere lægemiddelomkostningen for docetaxel til 0 istedet.\nSet i lyset af at Amgen her har dokumenteret valget af denne takst, ved at konsultere to kliniske eksperter på\nforskellige hospitaler, der har adspurgt relevant personale på deres respektive afdelinger om hvilke takster der\nanvendes ifbm. administration af docetaxel - og at disse klinikeres kontaktoplysninger er delt med\nmedicinrådet - så finder vi ikke ovenstående argumentation fyldestgørende.",

Overall survival by line of therapy in patients with KRAS G12C mutation (Danish registry analysis)\nThe study designs might affect the comparison of outcomes as CodeBreak 100 is an open-label single-\narm study and SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled study. Further, CodeBreak 100 include\npatients with prior anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas there were no patients with prior PD-1 treatment\nincluded in SELECT-1. Although CodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, restricting\nmatches to only patients with 1 prior therapy, as were included in SELECT-1, would reduce the available\nCodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which would have significant implications for the precision of any\nrelative treatment effect estimates. The inability to robustly match for number of prior lines of therapy\nor prior use of immunotherapy is a potential limitation that arises due to limited comparator trial data\nspecifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes are likely to be worse for patients\nwith each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57% of patients with 2 or more\nprior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the CodeBreak 100 NSCLC\npopulation against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of\ntherapy, is likely to be conservative. This assumption is further validated as subgroup analysis from\nCodeBreak 100 showed median OS in patients that received only 1 prior line of therapy XTable 8 patient\nTable 16.

This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from\nSOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in\nperformance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond\n(2L+) chemotherapy. Therefore, this patient group (KRAS G12C NSCLC) has a particularly high unmet need for\neffective and tolerable therapies, that can improve survival outcomes without compromising health-related\nquality of life (HRQoL) including toxicity.",

Evidence from CodeBreak 100 indicates that sotorasib is highly\neffective when used in line with its indication as a second- or subsequent-line therapy. Median progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 12.5 months in the trial.\nThere is a lack of head-to-head trial data specifically considering KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. However, indirect\ntreatment comparisons using robust data sources and methods provide plausible early evidence of clinically\nmeaningful improvements in survival outcomes for patients treated with sotorasib compared with the current\nstandard of care, non-targeted therapy. For Docetaxel, the SELECT-1 trial was identified as the data basis in KRAS\nG12C-mutated NSCLC 2L patients. Median PFS X and median OS was X OS in SELECT-1 for docetaxel\nmonotherapy.\nThe clinical value of sotorasib compared to docetaxel is best demonstrated by the critical outcome measures\nPFS and OS. The results from the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) for PFS, demonstrate that\nsotorasib provides X gain in median PFS compared with docetaxel monotherapy (X This exceeds the minimal\nclinically important difference of 3 months in median PFS(7) set by the Danish Medicines Council (DMC). For OS,\nthe MAIC indicates that sotorasib provides a X gain in median OS compared with the primary comparator\ndocetaxel monotherapy (X. This exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of 3 months in median OS(7)\nset by DMC.\nSafety outcomes were compared narratively and were limited by the fact that exposure times in the available\nevidence were not comparable between the sotorasib and docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 5.5\nmonths for sotorasib and 2.4 months for docetaxel. Sotorasib presented a lower occurrence of grade 3 or worse\ntreatment-related adverse events (TRAE) (20% vs 30%) and a lower numerical rate of treatment discontinuations\ndue to AEs (9% vs 14.5%). Patients with NSCLC generally report high symptomatic burden and impaired physical\nfunction and quality of life(8, 9). Health-related quality of life was investigated in CodeBreak 100 using the EORTC\nQLQ-C30 measure. Patients treated with sotorasib generally sustained or improved compared with baseline.\nSotorasib is expected to be safer and more tolerable compared to docetaxel, aligning with the clinical\nexpectation of safety of a targeted therapy compared to chemotherapies.\nIn conclusion, sotorasib can address the significant unmet need for a targeted, more effective, tolerable, and\nconvenient treatment that improves clinical outcomes for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC compared\nto the current standard chemotherapy option.",

Lung tumors differ\nwidely in terms of growth rates and response to treatment (10-12). However, metastatic lung cancer is almost\nuniformly and rapidly fatal (10). Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve the prognosis\nof patients with lung cancer.\nWhile the survival of lung cancer patients has been steadily increasing the last half decade, likely due to\nintroduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapies for managing advanced NSCLC in Denmark(4), lung\ncancer still remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in Denmark, representing 21.9% of cancer related\ndeath for males and 23.5% for females between 2015 and 2019(13). Data from the Danish Lung Cancer registry\nshowed that the observed 2-year survival for patients on palliative treatment was 23.2%, an increase of 10%\nfrom 2014 (12.7%). While the observed 5-year survival for patients on palliative treatment was 4% for the latest\ncohort.\nIn 2020, 4876 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer in Denmark(4). NSCLC accounts for approximately 87.5%\nof lung cancer cases in Denmark(4) and comprises several histological subtypes, which can be categorized into\nsquamous and non-squamous. Approximately 79% of NSCLC is non-squamous, adenocarcinomas (~ 48%) (4),\nrepresents the most common subtype of NSCLC in Denmark.\nAdenocarcinomas develop from the mucus-producing cells of smaller airways along the periphery (outer edges)\nof the lung (14, 15). Although adenocarcinomas mostly occur in current or former smokers, they are also the\nmost common type of lung cancer in people who have never smoked (15). The remainder of the non-squamous\nNSCLC tumors are rare subtypes and non-small cell carcinoma and other specified carcinomas (52.1%)(4). Brain\nmetastases are found in approximately 10% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC and 26% of patients with\nstage IV disease (16). Other common sites of metastases include the liver, adrenal glands, and bones. The\ndistribution of types of lung cancer by histology in Denmark is shown in Figure 1.",

Lung adenocarcinomas also\nhave a very high tumor mutation burden (~ 8.9 somatic mutations per megabase) (20-22), and more than 50%\nof lung adenocarcinomas have at least 1 genetic mutation, rearrangement, fusion, and/or amplification that is\nknown to initiate and drive tumor growth (23).\nThe introduction of genomic testing and drug therapies targeting specific driver mutations represent major\nbreakthroughs in the treatment of NSCLC (24). Currently, targeted therapies are approved by EMA for NSCLC\ntumors with alterations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF), epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR), mesenchymal-epithelial transition gene (MET), rearranged during transfection (RET), c-\nros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) genes (25). Comprehensive\nmolecular testing at NSCLC diagnosis is recommended to optimize the use of tissue for testing and to inform\ntreatment selection for metastatic disease in Denmark(2, 3). The timely identification of patients who are\ncandidates for targeted therapies and administration of appropriate therapy has been shown to improve clinical\noutcomes in NSCLC (1, 26-28). However, oncogenic driver mutations still remain for which no targeted therapy\nhas been successfully developed. These include KRAS mutations, of which the most frequently occurring in\nNSCLC is the KRAS G12C mutation (29).",

Mutations in KRAS genes can disrupt the processes involved in the proliferation and survival of\ntumor cells. Of the KRAS mutations, an estimated 80% occur at codon 12. The KRAS gene with a mutation\nresulting in a G12C amino acid substitution (KRAS G12C mutation) in codon 12 is a single guanine to thymine\nsubstitution that results in a glycine to cysteine substitution at amino acid position 12. This structural change in\nthe protein results in a defect in the association of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which reduces the normal\nhydrolysis of GTP by GTPases, and resulting in the accumulation of KRAS proteins in the ‘active’ state. The\nresulting accumulation of active, GTP-bound KRAS proteins disrupts the process of apoptosis and promotes\ntumor proliferation and survival (31). The KRAS G12C mutation is therefore an oncogenic driver and KRAS\nmutations are generally acknowledged as negative prognostic factors for both treatment response and survival\noutcomes in patients with NSCLC, as well as other solid tumors (32, 33).",

In Denmark, all patients diagnosed with\nNSCLC undergo NGS-testing as part of the diagnostic trail to identify relevant targetable mutations including\n(EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1/ALK, RET, KRAS). As part of this NGS panel, KRAS G12C can be identified in the SOC\ndiagnostic trail.

This equates to 292 KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC cases in Denmark in 2020. The\nestimated incidence of the KRAS G12C mutation is similar to the incidence suggested by two Danish clinical\nexperts within NSCLC(2, 3). The two clinical experts suggested an annual incidence of 250-300 KRAS G12C\nmutations eligible for 1L treatment. Based on clinical validation, approximately 50% of the patients reach 2L\ntreatment each year.

      "text": "Tumor-targeted therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with molecular\nalterations in EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS, and RET proteins. However, the KRAS G12C mutation rarely occurs at the\nsame time as these other actionable mutations, meaning that existing tumor-targeted therapies are not an\noption for patients with KRAS G12C mutation (58-61). Patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are therefore\nmanaged in the same way as those without an actionable mutation.\nIn line with the current treatment guidelines from the DLCG (6), clinical experts (2, 3) confirmed that an\nincreasing majority of patients in Denmark with NSCLC without currently actionable mutations now receive anti-\nPD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in the first-\nline of therapy.\nClinical experts confirmed that sotorasib would be used as an alternative to docetaxel monotherapy following\nrecurring disease after frontline therapy with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy(2, 3). The\nproposed positioning of sotorasib, in line with its licensed indication, is therefore as a second or subsequent line\ntherapy following prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.\nThis positioning is aligned with the pivotal clinical trial data supporting the conditional EU regulatory approval\n(CodeBreak 100) and confirms that the relevant comparator for sotorasib is docetaxel monotherapy. Further, as\ndocetaxel monotherapy is recognized in the DOLG guideline as the second- and subsequent-line option in\nNSCLC, docetaxel is deemed the appropriate comparator for this appraisal (6).\nDocetaxel has not been approved as standard treatment for NSCLC by the DMC and according to the DMC\nguidelines if this is the case companies should develop CUA that estimates the cost-effectiveness of the\nchosen comparator against either placebo or BSC. This has not been developed as there are no clinical data\nenabling a CUA between docetaxel and placebo/BSC for the relevant patient population. Furthermore, we\nconsider docetaxel to be the most relevant and cost-effective comparator. In current clinical practice, the\nmajority of patients in 2nd line who are candidates for treatment will be offered treatment with docetaxel.\nWe find it very unlikely that patients will be offered an inferior treatment, such as placebo or BSC, in that\ndocetaxel is both a cheap treatment regimen with demonstrated efficacy and is an established treatment in\ncurrent Danish and international clinical practice. This is also supported by the fact that in the recent\nassessment of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer, the Medicine Council concluded that active\ntreatment, including docetaxel, was the appropriate comparator to address the decision issue.\nWe find it very likely that docetaxel will be a cost-effective alternative in a comparison with either placebo or\nBSC. As mentioned above, recent changes in frontline treatment means platinum-based chemotherapy is now\na relevant treatment alternative for patients with PD-L1>50% in 2L that has been given checkpoint inhibitor\nmonotherapy in 1L.\nAmgen is not aware of specific clinical trials investigating the efficacy of platinum chemotherapy as a 2.L\ntreatment for the relevant patient population after first-line immunotherapy, and therefore it has not\nbeen possible to include platinum-based chemotherapy as a comparator arm in an appropriate manner in\nthe application.\nAs there is no relevant data for platinum-based chemotherapy to address the decision question, we have\nconsulted a clinical expert and validated that Docetaxel is also a relevant comparator across PD-L1>50% levels\nfor NSCLC as a chemoalternative. Docetaxel is also referred to in the DMCG clinical guidelines for the treatment\nof 2L NSCLC.\nWe expect that the cost-effectiveness of sotorasib versus platinum-based chemotherapy will be equal to the\ncost-effectiveness versus docetaxel, since these are low-cost treatment regimens, both of which have a very\nlimited clinical efficacy. The expected incremental costs as well as effects for sotorasib versus platinum-based\nchemotherapy as well as docetaxel are therefore assumed to be comparable. The best alternative to assessing\ncost-effectiveness versus platinum-based chemotherapy is to use data from the Flatiron database (Appendix L -\nFlatiron). These data are based on a basket of chemotherapy regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy\nwhich is the most common regime in the basket (Table 60).\nThis analysis was performed as a confirmatory analysis to validate the primary MAIC analysis of sotorasib\nversus docetaxel monotherapy using a basket of chemotherapies as a source to represent docetaxel.\nHowever, given that the most common chemoregimen in the basket of chemotherapy regimens in the Flatiron\ndataset was platinum-based chemotherapy the analysis also represent a pragmatic approach to show that the\nresult of sotorasib versus platinum-based chemo does not differ significantly from the comparison of sotorasib\nvs docetaxel.\nThe analysis using the Flatiron chemobasket as a comparator was included as a scenario analysis. The dataset\nfor the comparator arm can be changed in the CE model.",

Patients who are eligible for further treatment in 2L or\nsubsequent-line therapy receive docetaxel as also described in the clinical guideline by the DLCG (6). Sotorasib,\nis therefore expected to displace docetaxel in 2L treatment.\nSotorasib is an inhibitor of the KRAS G12C-mutated protein. It forms an irreversible covalent bond highly-\nspecifically with the unique cysteine of KRAS G12C, locking the protein in an inactive state that inhibits\ndownstream signaling, inhibits cell growth, and promotes apoptosis in KRAS G12C tumor cell lines (62). No other\nwild-type or mutant protein or receptor has been identified to which sotorasib binds, nor has any effect been\nobserved in cells without the KRAS G12C mutation. As the KRAS G12C mutation only has been found in tumor\ntissues, and not in normal tissue (63, 64), sotorasib has the potential to be highly tolerable compared with\nstandard of care chemotherapy.\nAs an inhibitor of KRAS G12C, the presence of a KRAS G12C mutation must be confirmed using a validated test\nprior to initiation of therapy with sotorasib. In Denmark, KRAS testing is part of regional standards for NGS panels\nused as part of the diagnosis of NSCLC patients. Therefore, no additional tests beyond the routine diagnostic\nworkup and management of patients with NSCLC are required alongside the introduction of sotorasib.

This\napproach is deemed feasible as the global SLR was broader and will therefore have included all studies relevant\nfor the scope of this application.\nThe local adaptation was conducted to restrict the literature included in the global SLR to studies with either\nsotorasib or docetaxel in adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated in 2L+.\nThe local adaptation only included comparator studies with sufficient sample size and reporting to allow for a\nMAIC, which was necessary as the primary evidence for sotorasib was a single-arm trial. These selection criteria\nwere applied to the studies as they reflect the EMA-indication and proposed scope of the application for\nsotorasib for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in Denmark.\nIn brief, an SLR was commissioned to identify RCTs that report clinical effectiveness and safety of 2L therapies\nlicensed in the United States and the EU.

Safety outcomes were compared narratively in section 7.2.2, as exposure times were\nnot comparable between sotorasib and docetaxel.\n7.1 Efficacy and safety of sotorasib versus docetaxel in previously treated adults (2L or subsequent-line)\nwith KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC\n7.1.1 Relevant studies\nTwo relevant clinical studies (72, 73) were identified for the assessment which reflect the expected clinical\npractice in Denmark where sotorasib is expected to be used in 2L or as subsequent-line in adult patients with\nKRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, who previously failed 1L therapy.\nCodeBreak 100 (73) is an open-label, multi-national, single-arm, phase II study evaluating the clinical efficacy,\nsafety, and tolerability in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who are\ncandidates to 2L or a subsequent-line of therapy. All patients were required to have experienced disease\nprogression after the receipt of anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy or platinum-based combination\nchemotherapy or after the receipt of both immunotherapy and platinum-based combination chemotherapy.\nStudy design and baseline characteristics of the study population are respectively presented in Table 11 and\nTable 12.\nSELECT-1 (72) was identified as the appropriate study to be used as the comparator study, where patients receive\ndocetaxel. SELECT-1 is a multi-national, randomized, phase III study evaluating the clinical efficacy of selumetinib\nin combination with docetaxel as second-line therapy for advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. SELECT-1 included\nplacebo plus docetaxel as a comparator arm, this comparator arm will form the data basis for the clinical\nevidence of docetaxel in this appraisal. All patients were required to have radiological documentation of disease\nprogression following 1L or subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Study design and baseline characteristics of the\nstudy population are respectively presented in Table 11 and Table 12.\nThe study designs might affect the comparison of outcomes as CodeBreak 100 is an open-label single-arm study\nand SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled study. Further, CodeBreak 100 include patients with prior anti-\nPD-1 treatment, whereas there were no patients with prior PD-1 treatment included in SELECT-1. Although\nCodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, restricting matches to only patients with 1 prior\ntherapy, as were included in SELECT-1, would reduce the available CodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which\nwould have significant implications for the precision of any relative treatment effect estimates. The inability to\nrobustly match for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is a potential limitation that\narises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes\nare likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57%\nof patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the\nCodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one\nprior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative. This assumption is further validated as subgroup analysis from\nCodeBreak 100 showed median OS in patients that received only 1 prior line of therapy was 17.7 months (7.9,\nNE) (Amgen data on file)\nTable 8 patient subgroups by prior lines of therapy (Amgen data on file)\nN mOS\nPatient subgroups\n(OS) months (95% CI)",

In this analysis, the relative efficacy was\nassessed using an unanchored MAIC, a method that allows assessment of efficacy benefit between treatments\nwhen a common comparator is missing by adjusting for population-level differences present in different data\nsources (74).\nThe MAIC used data from two clinical studies: the CodeBreak 100 trial for sotorasib and the SELECT-1 trial for\ndocetaxel.

A comparison of the CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 studies is presented in Table 11.

Data on docetaxel-treated patients was taken from the\nSELECT-1 Phase 3 RCT of patients randomized to selumetinib plus docetaxel or docetaxel plus placebo (Janne et\nal, 2017). As patient-level data was not available for docetaxel, baseline patient characteristics and Kaplan–\nMeier PFS and OS curves were digitized and pseudo-patient-level data were created using the algorithm of Guyot\net al. (Guyot P. et al, 2012).\nCodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 reported PFS and OS as primary or secondary endpoints. In SELECT-1, PFS was\nmeasured by RECIST 1.1 every 6 weeks by the investigator. In CodeBreak 100, PFS was also measured by RECIST\n1.1 every 6 weeks for the first 8 assessments, and every 12 weeks subsequently. PFS was assessed by both\nindependent central review and by an investigator. The latter (investigator-based PFS) was used in the base-case\nof the MAIC analyses, as it is aligned with the progression assessment reported in the SELECT-1 trial.\nCodeBreak 100 is a single-arm Phase II study, whereas SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled phase III\nstudy.

Approximately 82% of subjects are white in CodeBreak 100, with comparable\nestimates higher in SELECT-1 (where 95% of patients are white).\nAdjustment for brain metastases was not possible as they were not reported for SELECT-1.\nKRAS G12C mutation status could not be used for the adjustment, as all CodeBreak 100 patients were KRAS G12C\npatients, and for the docetaxel arm in SELECT-1, there was no patient-level data available. CodeBreak 100\nincludes patients with prior anti-PD-(L)1 treatment, whereas SELECT-1 patients did not.

These discussions involved separate interviews with physicians\nexperienced in treating advanced NSCLC patients who have a robust understanding of the current NSCLC\ntreatment landscape. The literature was also reviewed to better understand what the most important\nconfounding factors are (for prognosis), and to consider their inclusion in the matching algorithm/propensity\nscore analysis.

      "text": "The economic evaluation was developed using a cost-effectiveness framework in Microsoft Excel®. A partitioned\nsurvival analysis was used based on three distinct health states (Figure 6): progression-free, progressed disease,\nand dead. All patients entered the model in the progression-free state and were at risk of progression of disease\nor death. Transitions to the death state occurred from either the progression-free or progressed disease health\nstates. Death was an ‘absorbing state’, where once entered, patients reside for the remainder of the model time\nhorizon.\nFigure 6. Partitioned survival analysis model\nThis model structure is fully aligned with the primary objectives of treatment in oncology and NSCLC, namely\navoiding disease progression and prolonging life. Furthermore, the structure and health states selected are\ntypical of modelling in oncology and have been used in previous NSCLC technology appraisals.\nThe model contains the three most relevant disease related health states:\n• Progression-free: Patient disease is in a stable or responding state and not actively progressing. Patients\nin this state are assumed to incur costs associated with treatment, administration, medical\nmanagement of the condition and the management of grade 3/4 adverse events.\n• Progressed: Patient disease has progressed. This health state is associated with costs of disease\nmanagement in post-progression.\n• Death: This is an absorbing state.\nThe proportions of patients in each health state at the beginning of each model cycle are calculated from the\nPFS and OS survival functions from relevant clinical trials as follows, where PF(t) is the proportion of patients\nwho are progression-free at time (t), Dead(t) is the proportion of patients who are not alive at time (t) (1 – OS)\nand PP(t) is the proportion of patients who are not progression-free and who are still alive at time (t). In the\nmodel, all patients start treatment in the progression-free health state:\nThe estimated time on treatment for each treatment in the analysis was used to inform acquisition costs and\nrelated administration costs. Additional costs included in the analysis include disease management costs per\nhealth state and subsequent treatment cost. As discussed in Section 8.5.2.3, costs associated with genetic\nmutation testing are not required to be captured in the model because KRAS G12C testing is routinely funded as\npart of panel testing at diagnosis. It is therefore assumed that all patients entering the model have a KRAS G12C\nmutation-positive status.\nThe progression-free health state typically reflects a relatively higher HRQoL associated with disease before\nprogression, where patients are receiving benefit from an active treatment, whereas the progressed disease\nstate is designed to capture the relatively poor HRQoL following disease progression. As the use of progression-\nstatus based utilities is common practice within oncology modelling, this have been chosen as the base-case in\nthe model. However, as previous studies have shown NSCLC patients to have markedly decreased utilities\ntowards the end of life, the measurements included in the model as a scenario analysis were informed by a time-\nto-death analysis (81). This approach has been used in previous NICE TAs (82-84).\nTime-to-death sub-health states were therefore implemented to capture patients’ quality of life as a function of\nhow much lifetime patients had left until they eventually died as predicted in the model. The use of time-to-\ndeath sub-health states was implemented considering four health states: less than 1 month before death, 1–3\nmonths before, 3–6 months before, and more than 6 months before death. This time-to-death approach was\nexplored in a scenario analysis.\nThe analyses were conducted from a restricted societal perspective and are consistent with DMC guidelines(85).\nThe model uses a 7-day cycle length, with a half-cycle correction applied and a time horizon of 20 years. This\naligns with the maximum life expectancy of the cohort predicted by parametric survival analysis and was\nconsidered appropriate by clinically experts given that it is highly unlikely for patients with NSCLC with the KRAS\nG12C mutation with advanced or metastatic disease to survive beyond this time point. The impact of the\nselection of the time horizon on results is explored in a sensitivity analysis. A discount rate of 3.5% per annum\nwas applied for costs and outcomes. The perspective chosen, time horizon assessed, and the discount rate used\nare all in line with the DMC guidelines.\n8.2 Relationship between the data for relative efficacy, parameters used in the model and relevance for\nDanish clinical practice",

Comparability of the data sources – and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a\nMAIC – was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the\nanalyses. Details of the comparison of studies, populations and methods used in the studies are presented in\nAppendix K - MAIC. Please consult section 7.2.1 for full details and the results of MAIC.\nFor extrapolation, parametric curves were fitted to the MAIC-weighted time-to-event data. A variety of options\nwere assessed which considered alternative distribution functions, i.e., consideration of independently versus\njointly fitted parametric models. As per the NICE decision support unit (DSU) guidance, extrapolations were\nassessed using goodness-of-fit statistics, visual match between the parametric fittings and the Kaplan-Meier\n(KM) data, and the clinical plausibility of long-term outcomes (88).\nFor the given MAIC-weighted data, the proportional hazards assumption and the presence of accelerated failure\ntime were assessed. This was done based on log cumulative hazard plots, Schoenfeld residuals, and QQ plots.\nThe proportional hazards assumption was found not to be certain for either OS or PFS. Aligned with these\nfindings and based on goodness-of-fit, a restricted and jointly fitted model was selected as the input for the cost-\neffectiveness model, with details provided for OS in Section 8.3.2 and for PFS in Section 8.3.3.\nThe extrapolations were assessed for visual match between the parametric fittings and the KM data, goodness-\nof-fit statistics and the clinical plausibility of long-term outcomes, in line with NICE DSU guidance (TSD 14) (88).\nIn addition to the MAIC vs. SELECT-1, the Flatiron real-world data were used for sensitivity analysis. Here, a real-\nworld chemotherapy-basket served as a proxy for docetaxel treatment. The rationale for this confirmative\nanalysis was first, that the SELECT-1 population was anti PD-(L)1 naïve. Second, as CodeBreak 100 is a single-arm\ntrial, this alternative approach was applied to demonstrate the robustness of the results.

This approach, however,\ncompared to the HR approach, is more complex but less accurate: The HR approach is based on a single\nparameter from a single trial. In contrast to OS and PFS, where time-to-event data of two trials are being\ncombined, for TTD SELECT-1 based KM curves do not exist. Adding MAIC weights across trials would add\ncomplexity but not accuracy. Furthermore, more degrees of freedom plus the selection of a parametric\ndistribution would be required. The HR approach better reflects the high causal relationship between PFS and\nTTD, as most patients discontinue treatment at progression. Independently fitted curves may unnecessarily yield\nmisalignment. And given that more than 80% of patients had discontinued sotorasib by the March 2021 data cut\nsnapshot there is low uncertainty related to the estimate\nWe believe there is a strong statistical case to “tether” TTD to PFS and this is consistent with the clinical use of\nsotorasib. Therefore, the HR approach sufficiently accounts for the strong relationship between TTD and\nPFS. These two curves should not be modelled independently. Comparing the modelled curves with the\ncorresponding KM curves shows the approximated relationship is reasonable.\nFurthermore, There is a strong precedent based on previous NICE submissions (and acceptance by appraisal\ncommittees) for methods that “tether” TTD to PFS for oncology medicines where this reflects how the treatment\nwill be used – i.e. where TTD tends to be around PFS but not the same. For example:\n• In NSCLC it is common to assume TTD=PFS if this is in-line with the licence and SmPC wording or\notherwise tether TTD to PFS by either applying a HR or adding a mean number of cycles of treatment\nat progression in the model (i.e. if TTD is slightly higher than PFS).

Sotorasib should therefore be made available as early as possible to address the high and urgent\nunmet needs of these patients, as real-world evidence suggests that the current prognosis for these patients is\npoor.\nAs the standard 2L treatment of advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in Denmark, docetaxel was selected as\nthe appropriate comparator.\nSotorasib was investigated in a single-arm clinical trial, CodeBreak 100. No direct head-to-head evidence was\navailable to compare the clinical efficacy of sotorasib and docetaxel. In such circumstances, the relative efficacy\nof two treatments can often be estimated using indirect treatment comparison methods for OS and PFS. In this\nanalysis, the relative efficacy was assessed using an unanchored MAIC. This method allows assessment of\nefficacy between treatments when a common comparator is missing by adjusting for population-level\ndifferences present in different data sources (74).\nThe MAIC used data from two clinical studies: the CodeBreak 100 trial for sotorasib, and the SELECT-1 trial for\ndocetaxel. Comparability of the data sources, and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a\nMAIC, was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the\nanalyses.",

An unanchored MAIC is based around a strong assumption that\nall effect modifiers and prognostic factors can be accounted for.\nThe proportion of patients with stable brain metastases (both trials excluded patients with active brain\nmetastases) was not reported in SELECT-1 and was 21% in CodeBreak 100 pre-matching (18% post matching).\nThe analysis is potentially conservative for the comparative efficacy of sotorasib vs. docetaxel in this regard, as\nthe presence of brain metastases is a negative prognostic factor, whereas in other previously treated NSCLC\nRCTs, the proportion of patients with stable brain metastases was consistently lower than in CodeBreak 100,\nsuggesting there were potentially fewer patients with brain metastases in the SELECT-1 trial.\nAs PFS and OS outcomes are likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy, the comparison\nis likely to be biased in favor of docetaxel due to the differences in the patient population between CodeBreak\n100 and SELECT-1. The SELECT-1 trial only included patients with one previous line of therapy. This compares\nwith 57% of patients having had more than one line of therapy in CodeBreak 100. Furthermore, there is limited\ndata for either sotorasib or docetaxel in patients with squamous KRAS G12C-mutated cancer.

In the base-case analysis, the ICER for sotorasib versus docetaxel was X DKK/QALY and on life-\nyears, the ICER was X DKK/LY. This would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of DKK 750,000 per\nQALY. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses are consistent with the base-case results, indicating that\nthe base-case results are robust to parameter uncertainty. The PSA estimated a X% probability that sotorasib is\ncost-effective compared to docetaxel at the given threshold of DKK 750,000 per QALY. The BIM suggested that\nthe estimated budget impact of recommending sotorasib as standard treatment in Denmark was X million DKK\nin year 1 and X million DKK in year 5, when assuming 125 new patients would be eligible for treatment with\nsotorasib each year.\nThe most clinically plausible extrapolations of PFS and OS data were selected for the base-case analysis and\nextensive scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of alternative modeling choices with only a\nsmall impact on the results of the analyses.\nA key strength of the analysis is that given the similarity of patient populations, the risk of bias is expected to be\nlow. However, due to the highly pre-treated population of CodeBreak 100, the potentially remaining bias most\nlikely favors docetaxel. Therefore, the outcomes of the MAIC analysis can be considered conservative. Secondly,\nthe model appears to be robust to parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty.

The indirect treatment comparison suggests that sotorasib provides a superior\ntreatment option for these patients compared to docetaxel, providing PFS and OS gains which exceed the\nminimally clinical important differences of 3 months, previously defined by the lung cancer expert committee at\nDMC(7).\nHealth economic analysis demonstrates that sotorasib is a more effective and more costly treatment option\ncompared to docetaxel that would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 750,000 DKK per QALY.\nThe interpretation of the current clinical evidence is somewhat limited by the current lack of a direct comparison\nbetween sotorasib and docetaxel. This limitation will be addressed in the future with results of the ongoing\nphase 3 randomized, active-controlled CodeBreak 200 study, where sotorasib and docetaxel are compared head-\nto-head.

Analyzing Health-Related Quality of Life Data\nto Estimate Parameters for Cost-Effectiveness Models: An Example Using Longitudinal EQ-5D Data from the SHIFT\nRandomized Controlled Trial. Adv Ther. 2017;34(3):753-64.\nAppendix A - Literature search for efficacy and safety of intervention and\ncomparator(s)\nA SLR was conducted to identify RCTs that report clinical effectiveness and safety of United States and EU\nlicensed second-line therapies. Randomized controlled trials (phase II - IV) of adults (18 years) with locally\nadvanced and unresectable or metastatic (stage IIIB-IV) NSCLC who had received at least 1 prior systemic therapy\nwere eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and\nevent-free survival (65), time to progression (TTP), time to next treatment (TTNT), response rates, disease\ncontrol rate, treatment duration and adverse events. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases,\nreference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and other supplementary sources.\nThe SLR conformed to published guidelines issued by the Cochrane Collaboration (1) and the Centre for Reviews\n& Dissemination (CRD; York, UK) and followed the methodological requirements of the National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence (NICE), UK, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n(66), and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and statements (66-70). The SLR search was\nconducted in June 2020. An updated search was conducted on 26 January 2021.\nSearches were conducted in Embase, Medline and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),\nfor the original and updated searches.",

      "text": "This SLR search strategy was based on that used in a recently published SLR by Schulz et al. (2019), which was\nconducted in the pretreated NSCLC population(100). Unlike Schulz et al. the current review set out to include\nonly those publications reporting outcome data for a KRASm population or subgroup in line with the objectives\nof this SLR. The current review therefore included any studies identified as relevant by Schulz et al, regardless of\npublication date, and all relevant studies published during or after 2015 identified by replicating the Schulz et.\nal (2019) search strategy (100). The replicated searches were run in June 2020 and updated again 26th January\nThe following electronic databases were searched via the OVID platform:\n• Embase, 1980 to present day\n• MEDLINE®, incorporating:\no MEDLINE®, 1946 to present day\no MEDLINE® In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations\no MEDLINE® Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE® Daily\n• The Cochrane Library, incorporating;\no the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews)\no the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\nThe database search strings identified relevant studies (full papers or conference abstracts) indexed in Embase,\nand were modified to perform the searches in MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, to account for differences in\nsyntax and thesaurus headings. Searches include terms for free text and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms.\nThe search strategy for each database, and associated number of hits, are presented below for the June 2020\nand the January 2021 update.",

However, the study has been sized to characterize the OS\nbenefit of selumetinib 75mg bd in combination with docetaxel. Approximately 500 KRAS\nmutation positive tumor patients will be randomized between the two treatment arms to\nobtain approximately 325 death events (65% maturity). The final analysis of PFS will take\nplace on a pre-specified date when it is predicted that 325 death events will have\noccurred. The exact date will be predicted by modelling the blinded death rate data.\nIf the true OS hazard ratio (HR) for the comparison of selumetinib 75mg bd in\ncombination with docetaxel 75mg/m2 vs. placebo in combination with docetaxel\n75mg/m2 is 0.72, this number of events will provide at least 80% power to demonstrate a\nstatistically significant difference for OS, assuming a 2% 1-sided Type I error. This OS HR\ncorresponds to an approximate 2-month improvement in median OS over an estimate of\n5.2 months (estimated from D1532C00016) for placebo in combination with docetaxel,\nassuming proportional hazards and exponential data distribution. A 2-month\nimprovement in median OS is regarded as clinically meaningful. The smallest treatment\ndifference that would be statistically significant at the final analysis is an OS HR of\napproximately 0.80 (0.796 if exactly 325 OS events).\nEfficacy data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using randomized treatment.\nPFS, OS, and time to symptom progression using the ASBI will be analyzed using a\nstratified logrank test. The results will be presented in terms of the HR, associated two-\nsided confidence interval (CI), and p-value. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots of PFS, OS, and time\nto symptom progression will also be presented. ORR and symptom improvement rate\nusing the ASBI will be analyzed using a logistic regression adjusted for the stratification\nfactors WHO Performance Status (1/0) and tumor histology (squamous/non-squamous).\nIn order to describe the nature of the benefits of selumetinib treatment, PFS, OS, ORR,\ntime to symptom progression, and symptom improvement rate will be tested at a 2-sided\nsignificance level of 5%. However, in order to strongly control the type, I error at 2.5% 1-\nsided, a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with an alpha-exhaustive recycling strategy\n(Burman et al 2009) will also be employed across the primary endpoint (PFS) and key\nsecondary endpoints (i.e., OS and ORR).\nSafety data will be summarised and listed for all patients who received at least one dose\nof study treatment (selumetinib/placebo) based on the treatment received. No formal\nstatistical testing will be performed on the safety data. Adverse events will be\nsummarised by preferred term and system organ class (using the Medical Dictionary for\nRegulatory Activities [MedDRA]). Summaries of AEs by causality and CTC grade will also be\npresented.\nPrespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing PFS between treatments in\nthe subgroups of the full analysis set defined by the stratification factors WHO PS and\nhistology, plus the following factors:\n• Gender (Male vs. Female)\n• Age at randomisation (< 65 vs. = 65)\n• Smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker (never smoker)\n• Status of disease (Locally advanced vs. Metastatic)\nThe purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect\nacross expected prognostic factors but from the results observed in Phase II\n(D1532C00016) it is not expected that these factors will be predictive factors for a\nqualitatively different treatment effect.

The systematic literature\nreviews described in Appendix A sought to identify clinical trials of therapies conducted in patients with KRAS-\nmutant NSCLC, and identified only one RCT (SELECT-1) that provided sufficient PFS and OS data for docetaxel\nmonotherapy (the primary comparator) in a population of patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC (including G12C\nand non-G12C mutations) (127).\nSeveral published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival\nin patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or\nwild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129). The SELECT-1 trial itself\nshowed that survival outcomes were highly consistent for those with KRAS G12C-mutated and those with other\nKRAS-mutated NSCLC (129). On this basis, the PFS and OS data for docetaxel from the SELECT-1 trial in patients\nwith KRAS-mutant NSCLC (including G12C and non-G12C mutations) is considered to be sufficiently reflective of\nPFS and OS in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who receive placebo plus docetaxel. The SELECT-1 trial\nwas therefore considered to be a candidate to provide comparator data for the primary comparison of sotorasib\nvs. placebo plus docetaxel. This approach was agreed as reasonable by the five UK clinical experts attending an\nAmgen advisory board meeting in February 2021 for the NICE submission (130).",

The data are considered adequate to reflect\nPFS and OS outcomes with sotorasib and placebo plus docetaxel following prior therapy in this population of\npatients.\nA propensity score weighted analysis approach such as MAIC requires the matching of prognostic patient\ncharacteristics to generate robust comparative treatment effect estimates. Due to missing data or other\ndifferences between the trials it would not be possible to match across all trials for KRAS G12C mutation status,\nbrain metastases, prior lines of therapy or prior use of PD-L1 inhibitors. Given that PFS and OS outcomes are\nsimilar in the absence of targeted therapies, irrespective of KRAS status, the inability to match by specific KRAS\nstatus is unlikely to lead to biased estimates. Patients with brain metastases were excluded from SELECT-1 trial\nwhereas CodeBreak 100 permitted enrolment of non-active brain metastases; however, as brain metastases are\nan important prognostic characteristic, the inclusion of patients with brain metastases in the CodeBreak 100\ntrial but not in the SELECT-1 trial may lead to conservative estimates of relative treatment effects for sotorasib.\nAlthough CodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, to match only patients with 1 prior therapy,\nas per SELECT-1 would effectively reduce the available CodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which would\nhave significant implications for the precision of any relative treatment effect estimates. The inability to robustly\nmatch for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is therefore a potential limitation that\narises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes\nare likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57%\nof patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the\nCodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one\nprior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative.\nSide 184/237\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th.

The following weighting and average\nbaseline characteristics will be balanced for the sotorasib-treated patients and the docetaxel-treated patients.\nWeights will be derived using an MAIC, a form of propensity score weighting (132). The propensity score logistic\nregression model estimates the odds of being enrolled into the CodeBreak 100 trial or the SELECT-1 trial. For\nthis, a method of moments will be used to allow a propensity score logistic regression model to be estimated\nwithout patient-level data for the comparative evidence sources. The model will be estimated on the basis of\nindividual patient data available for the sotorasib-treated patients and the published summary data available\nfor the SELECT-1 trial. Following estimation of the weights, it is necessary to explore their distribution. Re-scaled\nweights will be explored via the use of histograms to determine whether specific patient(s) or groups of patients\n(based on covariate values) will be over- or underrepresented in the analysis. The use of scaled weights aids\ninterpretation; a scaled weight of > 1 means that an individual carries more weight in the re-weighted sample\nthan in the original sample, and a scaled weight of < 1 means that an individual carries less weight.",

To mimic the treatment effect\ncompared to a hypothetical comparator arm in the CodeBreak 100 trial, the ATT was calculated, assigning\nweights to the subjects in the comparator arm (Flatiron propensity weighting score analysis).\nThe advantage of utilizing a propensity score analysis is to create a balance across multiple observed factors that\nare thought to affect prognosis between the sotorasib -treated subjects in the Phase II portion of CodeBreak 100\nand a historical comparator arm comprised of patients from the FIH-FMI CGDB. Such a balance, if adequately\nachieved, would limit bias and thus reinforce the validity of a statistical comparison of the clinical outcomes of\nsotorasib treated subjects vs. patients treated with chemotherapy-based standard of care.\nDue to sample size restrictions, and based on clinical expertise, the comparator cohort captured 206 patients\nwith any KRAS mutation; including 85 patients with KRAS G12C .
