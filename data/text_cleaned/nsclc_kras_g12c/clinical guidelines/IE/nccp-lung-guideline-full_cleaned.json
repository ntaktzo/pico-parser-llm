While the CEO, General Manager and the Clinical Director of the hospital have\ncorporate responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations in this Clinical Guideline, each\nmember of the multidisciplinary team is responsible for the implementation of the individual guideline\nrecommendations relevant to their discipline.\nThis guideline is also relevant to those involved in clinical governance, in both primary and secondary\ncare, to help ensure that arrangements are in place to deliver appropriate care for the population covered\nby this guideline.\nWhilst the guideline is focused on clinical care, it is expected to be of interest to patients with lung cancer\nand their significant others. Effort has been made to make this document more user friendly. A list of\nmedical abbreviations used throughout the guideline can be found in Appendix 9: Glossary of terms and\nabbreviations.",

      "text": "Providing standardised clinical care to patients in healthcare is challenging. This is due to a number of\nfactors, among them variations in environments of care and complex patient presentations. It is self-\nevident that safe, effective care and treatment are important in ensuring that patients get the best\noutcomes from their care.\nThe Department of Health is of the view that supporting evidence-based practice, through the clinical\neffectiveness framework, is a critical element of the health service to deliver safe and high quality care.\nThe National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) is a Ministerial committee set up in 2010 as a key\nrecommendation of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance (2008). The\nestablishment of the Commission was prompted by an increasing awareness of patient safety issues in\ngeneral and high profile health service system failures at home and abroad.\nThe NCEC on behalf of the Department of Health has embarked on a quality assured National Clinical\nGuideline development process linked to service delivery priorities. Furthermore, implementing National\nClinical Guidelines sets a standard nationally, to enable healthcare professionals to deliver safe and\neffective care and treatment while monitoring their individual, team and organisation’s performance.",

      "text": "Cancer is a major healthcare challenge. Each year in Ireland, approximately 20,804 people are diagno\nwith invasive cancer. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Ireland after diseases of\ncirculatory system.\nDeaths from cancer averaged about 8,655 deaths per year during 2011-2013, representing about 30%\nall deaths in that period (NCRI, 2016).\nLung cancer was the single most common cause of cancer death in Ireland from 2011-2012 (See Secti\n3.1 Epidemiology). Averaging 1,827 deaths annually, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer dea\nin both sexes (NCRI, 2016). The incidence of lung cancer in Ireland is projected to rise more rap\nin females than in males. By 2040 the rate of lung cancer is projected to increase by 136% in fem\n(Nordpred model) and 52% in males (NCRI, 2014).\nCancer incidence data from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) and population projections fr\nthe Central Statistics Office (CSO) have been combined by the NCRI to estimate the number of new can\ncases expected in five year bands from 2015 to 2040. The total number of new invasive cancer ca\n(including non-melanoma skin cancer) is projected to increase by 84% for females and 107% for m\nbetween 2010 and 2040, based only on changes in population size and age distribution (demography\ntrends in incidence since 1994 are also taken into account, the number of cases is expected to incre\nby between 86% and 125% for females (depending on the method of projection used) and by betw\n126% and 133% for males (NCRI, 2014).\nIn Ireland, there are eight hospitals designated as cancer centres and one satellite breast unit (Letterke\nGeneral Hospital). A cancer centre is characterised by the geographic concentration of all oncol\ndisciplines with sub-specialised expertise on a tumour specific/discipline basis to provide the critical m\nand support to achieve best practice in cancer care.\nAs well as these designated cancer centres, other hospitals provide cancer services such as chemother\n(Figure 1).\nDesignated Cancer Centres\n111 Mater Misericordiae Hospital\n222 St. Vincent's University Hospital\n9999 333 Beaumont Hospital\n444 St. James's Hospital\n555 Cork University Hospital\n666 Waterford Regional Hospital\n777 Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick\n888 University College Hospital Galway\n2255 99 Letterkenny General Hospital (satellite of\nGalway for breast and rectal cancer)\n9999 11114444 1188 Non-Cancer Centres\n111 Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght\n11115555 222 Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise\n2222 11 22 66 44 1199 5 4 3 55 44 33 M S N l a e ig a r o c s y G G U e e n n n i e v e r e r a a r l s l H i H ty o o s H s p p o i i t s t a a p l l i tal, Cork\n11110000 5555 1111333344 11 33 11 1166 221177 6 7 66 77 S K o e u rr t y h G In e f n ir e m r a a r l y H /V o i s c p to it r a ia l University Hospital, Cork\n888 South Tipperary General, Clonmel\n22 999 Mayo General Hospital\n1177 111000 Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe\n2200 111111 St. Luke's, Kilkenny\n2211 111222 Wexford General Hospital\n2266 11111111 111333 Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown\n111444 Cavan General Hospital\n111555 Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda\n8888 11112222 1166 St. Michael’s Hospital, Dun Laoghaire\n7777 1177 St. Columcille’s Hospital, Loughlinstown\n1188 Louth County Hospital\n2233 1199 Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan\n11 E\nN\nn\ne\nn\nn\ni\na\ns\ng\nG\nh\ne\nR\nn\ne\ne\ng\nra\nio\nl\nn\nH\na\no\nl\ns\nH\np\no\nit\ns\na\np\nl\nital\n2222 Roscommon County Hospital\n2233 Mallow General Hospital, Cork\n2244 Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar\n2255 Monaghan General Hospital\n2266 St John’s Hospital, Limerick\nFigure 1 Cancer Services in Ireland\neline\nosed\nthe\n% of\ntion\naths\npidly\nmales\nrom\nncer\nases\nmales\ny). If\nease\nween\nenny\nlogy\nmass\nrapy\nThe National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) engages regularly with the individual cancer centres and\nwith Hospital Group structures. Discussion of performance data, improvement plans, resources including\nmanpower, service planning and development takes place at regular review meetings between the NCCP\nand senior management at cancer centre and Hospital Group level. This provides an opportunity to share\ngood practice from other cancer centres, if relevant. Where resource issues are identified, these are\nincluded in the service planning process. As specific issues arise in hospitals, these are managed by senior\nhospital management.\nA Lead Clinician has been nominated for each of the common tumour sites (e.g. breast, lung, prostate,\ncolorectal) in each of the designated cancer centres, and for rarer tumour sites (e.g. oesophageal\ncancer) in those centres which offer a service for that cancer. The Lead Clinician chairs the governance\narrangements for their service within the cancer centre and participates in a National Leads forum for\nthat tumour site. In order to operate as a cohesive national clinical network for the purpose of clinical\naudit, sharing of good practice and problem solving, the lead clinicians from the cancer centres meet\ncollectively as a National Lead Clinicians Network. This supports consistency of care across the eight\ncancer centres.\nThe National Cancer Strategy (DoHC, 2006) recommended that national site-specific multidisciplinary\ngroups be convened to develop national evidence-based clinical guidelines for cancer care. The principal\nobjective of developing these guidelines is to improve the quality of care received by patients.\nA Guideline Development Group was established to develop evidence based guidelines for the diagnosis,",

This is usually where there\nare one or more peripheral lesions. CT is used to guide biopsy where lesions are in difficult to reach\nlocations or where they are completely surrounded by aerated lung. Ultrasound is used where the lesion\nabuts the chest wall and is visible on ultrasound. (NICE, 2011)\nPercutaneous FNA/biopsy is a highly sensitive technique for diagnosing lung cancer (sensitivity of 88–\n92%) (Schreiber and McCrory, 2003, Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001b). Fine needle aspirations can be guided\nby fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT or MRI. Larger cutting needles can also be used to obtain biopsy cores of\nintact tissue for histology. Sensitivity is greater for peripheral lung lesions than fibre optic bronchoscopy\n(Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001b). There is a high false negative rate (25%) resulting in limited ability\nto confirm a benign diagnosis.

It is well tolerated and complication rates are low. The treatment\ncan be delivered in a single session, usually requiring only a short admission. RFA is suitable for small\ntumours, usually of 3 cm diameter or less, although larger lesions may be considered suitable in certain\ncircumstances. (Lim et al., 2010)\nNo data have been published so far on the combination of RFA with chemotherapy for early stage non-\nsmall cell lung cancer. (Lim et al., 2010)\nLanuti et al. (2012) performed 55 ablations in 45 patients (age, 51 to 89 years) with stage I NSCLC. At a\nmedian follow-up of 32 months, locoregional recurrence (LRR) occurred in 21 (38%) within a mean of\n12±10 (range, 1-44) months from RFA. Recurrence was observed locally in the tumour bed in 18 (33%),\nin regional nodes in 4 (7%), and distant in 2 (4%). The mean maximal tumour diameter was 2.3±1.3\n(range, 0.7 to 4.5) cm. In tumours exceeding 3 cm, 10 (80%) were associated with LRR. Recurrent lesions\nwere treated with repeat RFA (5), radiotherapy (8), chemoradiotherapy (5), and chemotherapy (2).\nLocal control was achieved by repeat RFA in 2 of 5 (40%) or by radiotherapy in 8 lesions (100%), with 2\nregional nodal failures (median follow-up, 40±13 months). Overall survival among patients who did or\ndid not experience LRR was similar (32% to 35%). Repeat RFA was not associated with any significant\ncomplications or procedure-related 30-day mortality. The authors concluded lung RFA is associated with\nincreased rates of local failure in tumours exceeding 3 cm and in contact with larger segmental vessels.\nHowever, patients with local failure can be promptly salvaged with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy\n(SBRT/SABR) or repeat RFA, without detriment to overall survival.\nA retrospective cohort study (Hiraki et al., 2011) comprising of 50 non-surgical candidates (29 men and 21\nwomen; mean age, 74.7 years) with clinical stage I (Ia, n = 38; Ib, n = 12) histologically proven non–small\ncell lung cancer treated a total of 52 tumours with 52 ablation sessions. The median follow-up period was\n37 months. Local progression was observed in 16 (31%) of the 52 tumours. The median survival time was\n67 months. The overall, cancer-specific, and disease-free survivals were 94%, 100%, and 82% at 1 year,\n86%, 93%, and 64% at 2 years, and 74%, 80%, and 53% at 3 years, respectively.

Advantages of rigid bronchoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia include the\nability to remove large pieces of cancer, maintain adequate ventilation, and allow control of large volume\nhaemorrhage. Nonetheless, flexible bronchoscopy is increasingly used for debulking procedures. These\ntreatments are usually given to palliate symptoms and improve quality of life, but in some patients, relief\nof endobronchial obstruction will allow assessment for subsequent treatment with curative intent. (NICE,\nEndobronchial techniques available are either a) used to debulk the cancer (brachytherapy,\nelectrocautery, cryotherapy, thermal laser ablation and photodynamic therapy) or b) used to maintain/\nre-establish airway patency (endobronchial stenting). Thermal ablation, surgical debulking and stent\ninsertion were all favoured options where immediate relief of endobronchial obstruction is required,\nespecially if there is a relatively large cancer. Endobronchial debulking procedures are generally not\nsuitable in cases where the predominant cause of airway obstruction is extrinsic compression. In such\ncases airway stenting to maintain/re-establish airway patency and/or external beam radiotherapy aimed\nat treating the surrounding cancer may be considered. External beam radiotherapy is effective in around\ntwo-thirds of patients and is less invasive than the other endobronchial treatments (NICE, 2011).",

The predictive value of frozen\nsection ranges from 93% to 100% but not all articles clearly report the accuracy of frozen section analysis\n(Yamato et al., 2001, Yamada and Kohno, 2004, Yoshida et al., 2005, Watanabe et al., 2005).

Scraping or washing of staple lines with subsequent cytological analysis has been\nattempted (Higashiyama et al., 2003, Utsumi et al., 2010). When a sublobar resection is performed, frozen\nsection analysis of an interlobar, hilar, or any suspicious lymph node is a useful staging evaluation, and\nwhen positive nodes are found, a lobectomy is indicated when there is no functional cardiopulmonary\nlimitation.

In total,\n57 trials (11,160 patients) were analysed. In the trials comparing a doublet regimen with a single-agent\nregimen, a significant increase was observed in tumour response (OR, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI],\n0.37-0.47; p<0.001) and 1-year survival (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.91; p<0.001) in favour of the doublet\nregimen.

However, in patients with adenocarcinoma randomly assigned to cisplatin/\npemetrexed, survival was significantly better than for those assigned to cisplatin/gemcitabine (12.6 v 10.9\nmonths, respectively; p=0.03). This is supported by a recent meta-analysis (Pilkington et al., 2015) that\ncombined the results from Scalgliotti et al. (2009) and Gronberg et al.

They found that patients\nrandomised to pemetrexed as maintenance therapy had longer overall survival compared with those who\ndid not receive maintenance pemetrexed therapy (HR 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.89;\np=0.0003, I2=0%). At a baseline risk of 51% at 12 months, there would be 8% (83 per 1000) fewer deaths\nat 12 months (95% CI from 40 fewer to 121 fewer) for patients who received pemetrexed maintenance\ntherapy.\nThe three RCTs reported on quality of life and found either no difference in the majority of scores or\nsignificant delays in symptom deterioration in favour of patients who received pemetrexed maintenance\ntreatment (Ciuleanu et al., 2009, Paz-Ares et al., 2012, Rittmeyer et al., 2013). (Kulkarni et al., 2015)\nA significant interaction was observed between histology (squamous versus non-squamous carcinoma)\nand treatment for progression-free survival and overall survival in Ciuleanu 2009. The two other RCTs\nincluded only patients with non-squamous histology (Barlesi et al., 2013, Paz-Ares et al., 2013). Meta-\nanalysis with these two RCTs, plus the data from patients with non-squamous carcinoma from Ciuleanu\n2009, found that patients with non-squamous cell histology who received pemetrexed as maintenance\ntherapy had longer OS (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.86; p<0.0001) and PFS (HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63;\np<0.00001) compared with those who did not receive pemetrexed as maintenance therapy.

A second set of analyses excluding patients with pT4, synchronous primary or no\nbiopsy revealed similar results with the exception of the loco-regional occurrence rate which was now\nsignificantly higher in the patients who had received surgery. Multivariate analyses showed that in the\npatients who had received SBRT/SABR squamous histology and the presence of synchronous primary\ntumour were significant predictors of distant metastasis and in the patients who had received wedge\nresection, visceral pleural invasion and stage Ib were significant predictors of distant metastasis. In\naddition, in all patients, age > 71 years was a significant predictor of overall survival. No treatment-\nrelated deaths were observed as a consequence of either treatment, but a number of adverse events\nwere associated with both treatments.

(Vansteenkiste et al., 2013)\nSBRT/SABR has led to improved population-based survival in elderly patients (Haasbeek et al., 2012), and\nthe convenience of this outpatient therapy over three to eight visits has also led to a reduction in the\nproportion of untreated patients.

Using isotoxic dose escalation, 4D planning in this study would allow, on average, an\nadditional increase in total dose by a factor of 1.19 compared with 3D planned dose escalation. For 55 Gy\nin 20 fractions with a BED of 70.13 Gy this would mean an average increase to a BED of 83.3 Gy . Some\nstudies suggest that an increase in absolute dose of 1 Gy is associated with a 3% reduction in death (Kong\net al., 2005). By optimising dose prescription, potential gains for the patient in tumour control probability\n(TCP) can be realised while balancing the risk of acceptable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)\n(Machtay et al., 2012). Mean Lung Dose (MLD) was lower for 19/20 of 4D planned cases, with an average\nreduction from 13.1 Gy to 11.1 Gy. This reduction in MLD can allow for dose escalation and where this is\nnot possible, such as for conventional treatments that are not adapted or escalated, could theoretically\nlead to lower lung toxicity rates. (Cole et al., 2014)\nFour-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) based plans had lower planning target volume (PTV),\na lower dose to organs at risk and lower predicted NTCP rates on LKB modelling (p<0.006). The clinical\nalgorithm showed no difference for predicted 2-year survival and dyspnoea rates between the groups,\nbut did predict for lower oesophageal toxicity with 4DCT plans (p=0.001). There was no correlation\nbetween LKB modelling and the clinical algorithm for lung toxicity or survival. Dose escalation was\npossible in 15/20 cases, with a mean increase in dose by a factor of 1.19 (10.45 Gy) using 4DCT compared\nwith 3DCT plans. (Cole et al., 2014)\n4DCT can theoretically improve therapeutic ratio and dose escalation based on dosimetric parameters\nand mathematical modelling. However, when individual characteristics are incorporated, this gain may be\nless evident in terms of survival and dyspnoea rates.\n4DCT allows potential for isotoxic dose escalation, which may lead to improved local control and better\noverall survival. (Cole et al., 2014)\nMean follow-up times in the 4DCT/IMRT and CT/3DCRT groups were 1.3 (range, 0.1–3.2) and 2.1 (range,\n0.1–7.9) years, respectively. The hazard ratios for 4DCT/IMRT were <1 for all disease end points; the\ndifference was significant only for OS. The toxicity rate was significantly lower in the IMRT/4DCT group\nthan in the CT/ 3DCRT group. V was significantly higher in the 3DCRT group and was a significant factor\nin determining toxicity. Freedom from DM was nearly identical in both groups. (Liao et al., 2010)\nTreatment with 4DCT/IMRT was at least as good as that with 3DCRT in terms of the rates of freedom from\nlocoregional progression (LRP) and distant metastasis (DM).

(SIGN, 2014)\nWhen planning radical radiotherapy to the thorax it is crucial to take into account the dose delivered\nto the normal lung tissue, oesophagus, spinal cord and heart. In order to ensure the maximum sparing\nof normal tissues, three-dimensional treatment planning is mandatory (Senan et al., 2004). However,\ndefining limits of dose tolerated by these tissues is complex as these limits vary according to the total dose\ndelivered, fractionation regimen and use of concurrent chemotherapy (Milano et al., 2007, Schultheiss et\nal., 1995, van Baardwijk et al., 2008a, van Baardwijk et al., 2008b). The risk of developing radiotherapy-\ninduced lung toxicity can be estimated by calculating the dose-volume histogram of the lungs, including\nV and mean lung dose (MLD) (Graham et al., 1999, Kwa et al., 1998). (Lim et al., 2010)\nThe greatest limitation of thoracic radiotherapy is radiotherapy induced lung toxicity (Graham et al.,\nAccording to the Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) lung-specific\npaper (Marks et al., 2010) it is prudent to limit V to ≤30–35% and mean lung dose to ≤20–23 Gy (with\nconventional fractionation) if one wants to limit the risk of radiation pneumonitis to ≤20% in definitively\ntreated patients with non–small cell lung cancer.\nCole et al. (2014) investigated the potential dosimetric and clinical benefits predicted by using four-\ndimensional computed tomography (4DCT) compared with 3DCT in the planning of radical radiotherapy\nfor non-small cell lung cancer.\nTwenty patients were planned using free breathing 4DCT then retrospectively delineated on three-\ndimensional helical scan sets (3DCT). Beam arrangement and total dose (55 Gy in 20 fractions) were\nmatched for 3D and 4D plans. Plans were compared for differences in planning target volume (PTV)\ngeometrics and NTCP for organs at risk using dose volume histograms. Tumour control probability and\nNTCP were modelled using the Lyman–Kutcher–Burman (LKB) model. This was compared with a predictive\nclinical algorithm (Maastro), which is based on patient characteristics, including: age, performance status,\nsmoking history, lung function, tumour staging and concomitant chemotherapy, to predict survival and\ntoxicity outcomes. Potential therapeutic gains were investigated by applying isotoxic dose escalation to\nboth plans using constraints for MLD (18 Gy), oesophageal maximum (70 Gy) and spinal cord maximum\n(48 Gy). (Cole et al., 2014)\nIn addition to oesophageal dosimetry, the use of concurrent delivery of chemotherapy has been shown",

This suggests that despite close attention to dose\nconstraints and dose volume histogram (DVH) characteristics, clinical factors may have a larger impact on\npneumonitis risks and outweigh any improvements that 4DCT may convey on an individual basis.

PORT is often given in routine practice if pathological examination shows tumour at the resection\nmargin on the basis of retrospective series showing a reduction in the local recurrence rates following\nPORT (Massard et al., 2000, Kimura and Yamaguchi, 1994, Ghiribelli et al., 1999, Gebitekin et al., 1994,\nHeikkila et al., 1986) or an excess of local recurrence rates without PORT (Snijder et al., 1998). However,\nsome retrospective series have shown high local recurrence rates despite the use of PORT (Gebitekin\net al., 1994, Snijder et al., 1998). It should also be noted that a retrospective study showed an adverse\nimpact of radiotherapy on survival in patients irradiated for positive margins (Massard et al., 2000). (Lim\net al., 2010)\nA literature review on this topic suggested that patients with stage I and II disease and positive margins\nare more likely to benefit from PORT than patients with stage III disease (Wind et al., 2007). Indeed,\nsurvival of patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer and an R1 resection of the bronchial\nresection margin is significantly worse compared with the stage corrected survival after radical surgery\n(Liewald et al., 1992). The potential benefit of this treatment in terms of reduction of the risk of local\nrecurrence rate has to be weighed carefully against the risk of morbidity and mortality related to PORT.\n(Lim et al., 2010)\nThe optimal dose/fractionation for PORT is not known, but modern studies suggest that a dose in the\nrange of 50-55 Gy using conventional fractionation should be used (Trodella et al., 2002, Bogart and\nAronowitz, 2005). There are few randomised data investigating the benefit of PORT and its optimal\nsequencing in the context of adjuvant chemotherapy.

The cause-specific survival\nrate at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 28%, 15%, 11%, respectively, in patients who did not receive PCI\nand 45%, 24%, 17%, respectively, in patients who did receive PCI (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis of\ncause-specific and overall survival, age at diagnosis, sex, grade, extent of primary disease, size of disease,\nextent of lymph node involvement, and PCI were found to be significant (p<0.001). Significantly improved\noverall and cause-specific survival was observed in patients treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation\non unadjusted and adjusted analyses. This study concurs with the previously published European\nexperience. PCI should be considered for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer.\nThe optimum dose of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)\nis unknown. A randomised clinical trial (Le Pechoux et al., 2009) compared the effect of standard versus\nhigher PCI doses on the incidence of brain metastases. Seven hundred and twenty patients with limited-\nstage SCLC in complete remission after chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy from 157 centres\nin 22 countries were randomly assigned to a standard (n=360, 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or\nhigher PCI total dose (n=360, 36 Gy) delivered using either conventional (18 daily fractions of 2 Gy) or\naccelerated hyperfractionated (24 fractions in 16 days with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy separated by a\nminimum interval of 6 h) radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range 0–89 months), 145\npatients had brain metastases; 82 in the standard-dose group and 63 in the higher-dose group.\nThere was no significant difference in the 2-year incidence of brain metastases between the standard PCI\ndose group and the higher-dose group, at 29% (95% CI 24–35) and 23% (18–29), respectively (HR 0.80\n[95% CI 0.57–1.11], p=0.18). Two hundred and twenty six patients in the standard-dose group and 252 in\nthe higher-dose group died; 2-year overall survival was 42% (95% CI 37–48) in the standard-dose group\nand 37% (32–42) in the higher-dose group (HR 1.20 [1.00–1.44]; p=0.05). The authors concluded that no\nsignificant reduction in the total incidence of brain metastases was observed after higher-dose PCI, but\nthere was a significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25 Gy should remain the standard of care in limited-\nstage SCLC. (Le Pechoux et al., 2009)",

It included 13 trials comparing\nchemotherapy alone to chemotherapy and thoracic RT totalling 2,140 patients, of which 433 were\nexcluded as they had extensive disease. 1,862 of the 2,103 patients who could be evaluated died; the\nmedian follow-up of the surviving patients was 43 months. The relative risk of death in the combined\ntherapy group compared to the chemotherapy group was 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94; p=0.001). There was\na 5.4% benefit in terms of overall survival at three years for the combined therapy group. The authors\nconcluded that thoracic RT moderately improves survival in patients with limited SCLC who are treated\nwith combination chemotherapy.\nThere is controversy regarding the optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy, with some meta-analysis\nsuggesting a small OS benefit of early delivery concomitantly to chemotherapy. However, this is associated\nwith an increase in treatment related toxicity (Lu et al., 2014, Spiro et al., 2006, Pijls-Johannesma et al.,\nSlotman et al., (2007) conducted a randomised trial (European Organisation for Research and Treatment\nof Cancer 08993-22993) of PCI in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who had had any\ndegree of response to chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo PCI or to receive no\nfurther therapy. The primary end point was the time to symptomatic brain metastases. CT scanning or\nMRI of the brain was performed when any predefined key symptom suggestive of brain metastases was\npresent, but was not done routinely prior to PCI. The two groups (each with 143 patients) were well\nbalanced regarding baseline characteristics. The cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was\n14.6% in the PCI group and 40.4% in the control group (HR 0.27; p<0.001). PCI was associated with an\nincrease in median overall survival from 5.4 to 6.7 months after randomisation. The 1-year survival rate\nwas 27.1% in the PCI group and 13.3% in the control group (p=0.003). PCI had side effects but did not\nhave a clinically significant effect on global health status. The largest mean difference between the two\narms was observed in fatigue and hair loss, which were greater in those who received PCI (Slotman et\nal., 2009). PCI reduced the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolonged overall survival in\npatients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (Slotman et al., 2007).",

(2015) assessed thoracic\nradiotherapy for treatment of this patient group.\nA phase III randomised controlled trial at 42 hospitals: 16 in Netherlands, 22 in the UK, three in Norway,\nand one in Belgium, enrolled patients with WHO performance score 0–2 and confirmed extensive-stage\nsmall-cell lung cancer who responded to chemotherapy. Four hundred and ninety-eight patients were\nrandomly assigned (1:1) to receive either thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions) or no thoracic\nradiotherapy. All underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. Three withdrew informed consent, leaving\n247 patients in the thoracic radiotherapy group and 248 in the control group.\nMean interval between diagnosis and randomisation was 17 weeks. Median follow-up was 24 months.\nOverall survival at 1 year was not significantly different between groups: 33% (95% CI 27–39) for the\nthoracic radiotherapy group versus 28% (95% CI 22–34) for the control group (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69–1.01;\np=0.066). However, in a secondary analysis, 2-year overall survival was 13% (95% CI 9–19) versus 3%\n(95% CI 2–8; p=0.004). Progression was less likely in the thoracic radiotherapy group than in the control\ngroup (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61–0.87; p=0.001). At 6 months, progression-free survival was 24% (95% CI 19–\n30) versus 7% (95% CI 4–11; p=0.001). No severe toxic effects were recorded. The most common grade 3\nor higher toxic effects were fatigue (11 vs 9) and dyspnoea (three vs four). (Slotman et al., 2015)\nThe authors concluded that thoracic radiotherapy in addition to prophylactic cranial irradiation should\nbe considered for all patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who respond to chemotherapy.\n(Slotman et al., 2015)\nThis is supported by a recent meta-analysis (Palma et al., 2016) that combined the RCT detailed above\n(Slotman et al., 2015) with an older RCT (Jeremic et al., 1999). Palma et al. (2016) examined the role\nof thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy for extensive-stage\nsmall-cell lung cancer. Overall, the delivery of TRT was associated with improved overall survival (HR\n0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.96; p=.014) and progression-free survival (HR 0.74; 95% confidence\ninterval, 0.64-0.87, p<.001). Bronchopulmonary toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was similar in both groups\n(≤2%). Oesophageal toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was 6.6% in the TRT arm and 0% in the non-TRT arm\n(p<.001). The study concluded that TRT improves overall survival and progression-free survival in patients\nwith extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, with a small incremental risk of oesophageal toxicity. Future\nrandomised trials to identify possible survival benefits of TRT dose escalation in patients with extensive-\nstage small-cell lung cancer would assist clinicians in selecting the optimal dose while minimising\noesophageal toxicity.",

      "text": "The Guideline Development Group (GDG) undertook a literature search for evidence of clinical- and cost-\neffectiveness, cost and resource impact, including primary (research studies) and secondary (reviews)\nsources. The literature sources searched are specified in the literature search strategy and include\nrelevant resources, such as trial/guideline registries and relevant citation databases. The economic\nliterature review was undertaken using the same search terms as derived from the clinical literature\nreview (available as a separate document) but with an economic filter applied. The results of this\nsearch were then refined by focusing on studies carried out in countries where the population, costs\nand treatment were considered similar to the Irish setting. All papers included (Figure 9) were subject to\nappraisal using the SIGN ‘Economic Evaluations: Methodology Checklist 6’ by a health economist and are\ndeemed of acceptable quality unless otherwise stated.\nBudget impact of this National Clinical Guideline\nFor recommendations which affect resource requirements, the budget impact was calculated. Additional\nresources, where required, will be sought through the HSE service planning process.\nThe burden of cancer is growing, and the disease is becoming a major economic expenditure for all\ndeveloped countries. In 2008, the worldwide cost of cancer due to premature death and disability (not\nincluding direct medical costs) was estimated to be US$895 billion. This is not simply due to an increase\nin absolute numbers, but also the rate of increase of expenditure on cancer. Several drivers of cost, such\nas over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and\nimaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies,\nhave converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system and a lack of\nevidence-based sociopolitical debate. (Sullivan et al., 2011)\n“The cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence-\nbase and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost.” (Sullivan et al., 2011) Sullivan et al. (2011)\nbelieve that value and affordable cancer care can be introduced into the cancer policy lexicon without\ndetracting from quality, and that the management tools, evidence, and methods are available to affect\nthis transformation across all developed countries.\nA population-based cost analysis (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013) illustrated the economic burden of\ncancer on the European Union (EU). In 2009, cancer was estimated to have cost the EU €126 billion,\nwith healthcare costs accounting for €51 billion (40%). In Ireland, inpatient care costs were estimated\nto account for €417 million of cancer-related healthcare costs out of a total of €619 million. Drug\nexpenditure accounted for a further €127 million, while primary, outpatient and emergency care were\nestimated at €32 million, €30 million and €13 million, respectively. Across the EU, lung cancer had the\nhighest economic cost (€18.8 billion) when compared to breast (€15 billion), colorectal (€13.1 billion) and\nprostate (€8.43 billion) cancer. The cost of lung cancer related productivity losses and informal care were\nestimated at €9.92 billion and €3.82 billion, respectively (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013). Irish healthcare\ncosts for the treatment of lung cancer were estimated to cost €13 per person (Luengo-Fernandez et\nal., 2013). In comparison the European average cost per person for the treatment of lung cancer was\nestimated to be €8. With cancer incidence expected to increase by 99% by 2040 (NCRI, 2014), there\ncould be a significant increase seen in healthcare costs per person in Ireland.",

      "text": "The search strategy for economic literature is based on the search used in the clinical literature review,\nwith the addition of a SIGN economic studies filter for Medline (Table 11. Economic literature review\nprotocol) including the former Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation\nDatabase (EED), Health Technology Assessment Database, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar.\nThe estimated costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) or life years gained (LYG) given in the following\nsummaries are those reported within each study for the given year and national currency. These cost-\neffectiveness ratios have been complemented in brackets by euro estimates to correct for the exchange\nrate, purchasing power parity (PPP) between countries and health inflation to 2014 costs as per the\nHealth Information and Quality Authority’s Economic Evaluation Guidelines (HIQA, 2014).\nThe following summaries report the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness made by the authors of\nthe reviewed literature. It is important to recognise that those conclusions are particular to the health\nsystems in the countries in which the studies are conducted in and reflect medical practice and healthcare\ncosts at the time the studies were undertaken. These practices and costs can differ significantly between\ncountries, even between nations of comparable per capita income. Clearly current medical practice in\nIreland may differ from the context of the original studies and care must be taken not to over-interpret\nthe relevance of such evidence for Ireland. More specifically, it is important to note that cost-effectiveness\nanalysis (CEA) results can be highly contingent on what particular practices are compared and in what\nway. The conclusion that a given intervention is cost-effective in one setting may not hold true for\nanother if the baseline standard of care against which that intervention is assessed differs between the\ntwo settings.\nAnother reason for conclusions on cost-effectiveness to differ between countries relates to the prevailing\ncost-effectiveness threshold. While Ireland has no explicit cost-effectiveness threshold for non-drug\ninterventions, cost-effectiveness ratios falling within the region of €45,000/QALY are conventionally\nconsidered cost-effective in Ireland. As this threshold differs from the thresholds typically used in other\ncountries the statements of cost-effectiveness made in other contexts are not necessarily applicable\nto Ireland. In all cases possible the relevant Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) have been\nreported, thereby permitting comparison to the Irish threshold rather than relying on the original\nconclusion of each study relative to any national norms of cost-effectiveness in each case. It should be\nnoted that there are constraints regarding cost-utility and heterogeneity of practice.\nThe reported costs and cost-effectiveness ratios have been inflated to 2014 euro values and adjusted\nfor purchasing power parity (PPP). Nevertheless, it is also important to remember that there may still\nbe a number of other factors which mean that cost-effectiveness ratios from other countries are not\nnecessarily directly applicable to the Irish setting. For example, Ireland’s discount rate is higher than that\napplied in the UK, so many interventions assessed in the UK would have less favourable ratios if the Irish\ndiscount rate was applied. Similarly, some analyses are conducted from the societal perspective and may\naccount for more costs and benefits than are considered in Irish cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), which\nonly account for costs to the health sector and do not typically include non-health benefits. Accordingly,\nthe euro-adjusted ratios reported here should only be considered broadly indicative of the level of cost-\neffectiveness rather than precisely adjusted estimates for the Irish health system.\nFinally, it should be noted that there is very little available literature on the cost-effectiveness of the\ninterventions considered here. In most cases there is only one study per indication. This presents a\nconsiderable challenge in reaching conclusions regarding the likely cost-effectiveness of the interventions\nin question. It would be preferable to have a range of studies to compare in order to better judge evidence\nquality and to provide insight into the effects of methodological and empirical factors from each study\non the conclusions reached. However, the absence of a rich evidence base means that health economic\nevidence should be considered tentatively and the findings should only be considered broadly indicative\nof what might apply in Ireland currently.",

In light of that the budget impact and pharmacoeconomic\nassessment for this guideline defers to that process.\nThe existing reimbursement process for new cancer drugs or new indications for existing cancer drugs is:\nThe Department of Health agreed a pricing and reimbursement framework agreement with the\nPharmaceutical industry, the 2012 IPHA agreement. That has been further enhanced by the enactment\nand commencement of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, and the 2016 IPHA\nagreement.\nIn the agreement, the Department of Health agreed processes with the pharmaceutical industry with\nclearly documented procedures and timelines for the assessment of new medicines (IPHA agreement) in\nas timely a fashion as possible.

      "text": "Cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography in staging of non-small cell lung cancer and\nmanagement of solitary pulmonary nodules\nCao et al. (2012) presents a systematic review of the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in the\nstaging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the management of solitary pulmonary nodules. Their\noverall conclusion is that although the evidence appears mixed, it seems PET is either cost-saving or cost-\neffective relative to other intervention strategies.\nThe analysis searched four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS EED, and the Cochrane Health Technology\nAssessment Database) for literature on the cost-effectiveness of PET imaging. The authors assessed the\nidentified studies against health economic analysis quality checklist and only included those studies with\nhigh scores in the primary analysis. In all, they identified 18 studies for review. Data including costs and\neffects were extracted from the studies and assessed. They also extracted the principal conclusion from\neach analysis. The review goes on to consider a number of other studies that are apparently considered\nrelevant in the literature, but were either excluded due to low quality scores or not captured by the\nliterature search.\nThe review notes that all of the analyses used decision analytic modelling to reach their findings. The\nreview notes that results of the analyses are therefore contingent on the modelling assumptions made. It\nnotes the heterogeneity of key assumptions regarding the test performance. The review draws particular\nattention to the number of studies interpreting the cost-effectiveness results incorrectly, primarily due to\ninappropriate comparisons between strategies. To correct for this they present revised interpretations of\nthe cost-effectiveness ratios based on the reported costs and effects. It is important to note that there\nis great variety in the strategies compared, with different combinations of computed tomography and\nPET being considered. Despite this, the results show that strategies featuring PET are generally either\ncost-saving or have ICERs that are likely to be well within acceptable limits of cost-effectiveness. When\nthe review considers the finding of other studies not captured by the search strategy, these other studies\ngenerally support the conclusion that PET imaging is either cost-saving or cost-effective.\nThe review process is well described and the abstracting of data and correcting of erroneously\ninterpreted cost-effectiveness ratios are all strengths of this review. However, despite implementing\na clearly described search strategy, this analysis also goes on to review a large number of studies that\nwere not captured by the search string, which seems counter to the purpose of the systematic review.\nA further note of caution is that while the review indicates that PET imaging can be cost-saving or cost-\neffective, the results also show that PET imaging is not necessarily always cost-effective, as it depends on\nwhat particular combination of imaging is assessed. An additional caveat is that although the review by\nCao et al. (2012) itself is relatively recent, the studies considered within the review date back to between\n1996 and 2007. So the relevance of the findings to current clinical practice and service provision costs\nmay now be limited. In conclusion, the overall finding from this review should be interpreted as a heavily\nqualified endorsement of PET imaging as likely to be a rational strategy.\nCost-effectiveness of initial diagnostic strategy for pulmonary nodules presenting to thoracic surgeons\nDeppen et al. (2014) present a cost-effectiveness model to examine the cost-effectiveness of computer\nassisted navigational bronchoscopy (NB) as an alternative to positron emission tomography (PET) as a\ndiagnostic tool for patients with lung nodules. Their results suggest that NB is a cost-effective alternative\nto PET, although the differences in costs and effects appear relatively small.\nThe analysis uses a model to compare four diagnostic strategies: the current strategy of PET imaging; NB;\ncomputed tomogaphy guided fine needle aspiration (CT-FNA); and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical\nbiopsy (VATS). VATS is used as follow-up diagnostic procedure in all strategies in which VATS is not the first\ntest when the initial test fails to yield a diagnostic result. The principal analysis is conducted for nodules\nof between 1.5 and 2 cm in size and has a suspected lung cancer risk of 65% according to standard risk\nmodels in a 60 year old man with a history of smoking.\nThe results of the analysis find NB, CT-FNA and VATS all to be more costly and more effective than PET.\nNB and CT-FNA are found to be effectively equal in terms of costs and effects. VATS is dominated by NB\nand CT-FNA. The cost-effectiveness ratio of NB relative to PET is reported as $4,600/QALY (€3,945/QALY in\n2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). Accordingly, NB would be interpreted as a highly cost-effective\nintervention as its ICER is well within commonly applied thresholds, such as the €45,000/QALY threshold\napplied in Ireland. The NB strategy only provides 0.05 more QALYs than the baseline PET strategy and the\nincrease in costs of approximately $200 is less than 2% higher.\nThe analysis is reasonably well described, but there is more detail in the model description and results\nthat would have been beneficial. In particular, the analysis does not present many of the intermediary\nestimates such as the numbers of cases detected or numbers of false positives from the model,\naccordingly, it is not clear by what means the improved diagnostic performance leads to improved health\noutcomes. The analysis also did not apply discounting, which would have been appropriate in this case.\nWhile it seems unlikely that the application of discounting would result in the primary ICER estimate\nbecoming greater than commonly applied cost-effectiveness thresholds, the failure to apply discounting\nis a concern as it signals methodological weakness. Similarly, the ICERs for dominated strategies are not\nreported correctly. Finally, the specific analysis to a given nodule size and estimated cancer risk means\nthat it is unclear how the results presented here would apply to other cases more generally. Overall, while\nthis study indicates NB is a cost-effective alternative to PET more evidence from other studies would be\ndesirable.\nClinical effectiveness and cost-effectivenss of the diagnostic staging strategy of EBUS-TBNA combined\nwith EUS-FNA compared with standard surgical staging techniques\nSharples et al. (2012) present a cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative diagnostic procedures for NSCLC\nas part of a broader clinical comparison of combined endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration\n(EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) as an\nalternative to conventional surgical diagnostic technique of mediastinoscopy. They find combined EUS-\nFNA EBUS-TBNA (endosonography) to have lower expected costs and higher expected effectiveness than\nmediastinoscopy, but do not find either of these results to be significantly different from zero.\nThe analysis is based on a randomised control trial (RCT) of the two approaches at four sites which\nfollowed patients for six months. The results of the RCT are combined with quality of life data gathered\nwithin the study in a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis of the data that permits an examination of\nuncertainty in the findings.\nThe analysis notes that the principal differences in costs arise due to both differences in the costs of the\ndiagnostic procedure and differences in number of thoracotomies performed. The diagnostic costs were\nhigher in the endosonography group, but this was partly offset by lower costs for thoracotomies. The\nresulting expected cost-effectiveness estimates find that endosonography dominates mediastinoscopy,\nbut that the credible intervals for both incremental costs and effects estimates both cross zero.\nThis is a high quality study that is based on RCT evidence and directly elicited quality of life measures. The\nanalysis is well documented and the results are clearly reported. The insignificant difference in costs and\neffects means it is difficult to strongly conclude in favour of endosonography. However, the conventional\napproach within cost-effectiveness is to base recommendations on expected values, therefore on this\nbasis endosonography is the preferred strategy. Nevertheless, the differences in expected costs and\nQALYs between the two strategies are relatively small.",

However, the same study notes that PET is not always found to be cost-\neffective.\nThis is indirectly relevant to recommendation 2.2.1.3 which supports the use of PET-CT for nodal staging in\npatients with potentially resectable NSCLC prior to more invasive staging.\nThe evidence also suggests navigational bronchoscopy, CT-FNA and VATS are all more cost-effective than PET,\nalthough there are several methodological issues highlighted with the internal validity of this analysis and\nfurther research is necessary. This is relevant to recommendations 2.2.1.4 and 2.2.2.1 which discuss the clinical\neffectiveness of PET-CT as part of the clinical pathway.\nEUS-FNA combined with EBUS-TBNA is reported to have higher sensitivity and negative predictive probability,\nand so is expected to be slightly more effective and less expensive than using surgical staging alone.

      "text": "Cost associated with lobectomy performed thoracoscopically or via thoracotomy\nBurfeind Jr et al. (2010) conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing the two surgical methods for lobectomy.\nThe conventional procedure is to use posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT), while the alternative is using\nthoracoscopy (TL). Their principal finding is that TL results in no less QALYs than PLT, but has statistically\nsignificantly reduced costs. Accordingly, the authors conclude that TL is a cost-saving procedure relative\nto standard PLT.\nThe analysis is primarily an observational analysis of 113 patients treated with either TL or PLT at a US\nmedical centre between 2002 and 2004. The authors record the costs of surgery, including pre- and\npost-operative care for up to 30 days following the operation. The costs recorded are those incurred\nby the healthcare provider and relate to the direct use of resources. Patients completed quality of life\nquestionnaires at four time points: preoperative, and 3, 6 and 12 month postoperatively to determine\nthe differences in health related quality of life over a year following the operation. The procedures are\nconsidered equivalent in terms of overall survival from cancer, so there are no long term differences\nassumed for the costs of each intervention after the 30 days of observation. Discounting of costs and\nhealth effects was not applied because the differences in costs and effects of the procedures were only\nassessed over a short time span. Similarly, no adjustment is made for inflation. The analysis does not\ncontain a sensitivity analysis as it is primarily an observational rather than a modelling study. It does\nclearly report error bounds on all the principal outcome measures reported.\nThe authors find no statistically significant difference in QALYs between the two procedures, hence they\nconclude them to be equally effective. They find the mean costs of PLT and TL to be $12,119 and $10,084\nrespectively (€17,700 and €14,700 respectively in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). They find\nthe difference between these two costs to be statistically significant, and so conclude that TL is cost-\nsaving relative to PLT. The difference in costs between the interventions is largely attributed to lower pre-\noperative costs and reduced length of stay for the less invasive TL procedure.\nOverall this analysis appears well conducted and the conclusion that TL is cost-saving relative to PLT is\ncredible. Nevertheless, there are some important limitations to this study that need to be recognised.\nThe study does not feature randomisation between the two interventions. While this may raise concerns\nregarding the validity of the findings, it should also be noted that the study has demonstrated no\ndifference in a range of patient characteristics between the intervention groups. More relevant to issues\nof external validity is the fact that the data for this study date from 2002 to 2004 and originate in the US,\nso the findings might not necessarily be representative of current care in Ireland. Notably, the quality\nof life measures employed failed to find a difference between the techniques, despite the finding of\nprevious authors that TL is associated with reduced postoperative pain. This may be because the quality\nof life measure lacked sensitivity or was not employed at the relevant time point. However, this is not\nof great importance as it does not alter the conclusion that TL is a rational alternative to PLT given the\nevidence presented from this case.",

The search was run to assess the cost-effectiveness of first-\nline and maintenance therapy for NSCLC. A large number of treatment and treatment combinations\nare examined in the review. These include, cisplatin-pemetrexed, cisplatin-gemcitabine, carboplatin-\npaclitaxel, bevacizumab, cisplatin-vinorelbine, cisplatin-docetaxel, gemcitabine-vinorelbine, erlotinib,\ngefitinib, afatinib and crizotinib. While the review is systematically described, the data extraction and\nreporting are not. The results of the review are presented within the text rather than in tables. It broadly\nconsiders interventions with ICERs below $50,000/QALY (€46,200/QALY adjusted for inflation and PPP) to\nbe cost-effective.\nThe report considers the reported costs and cost-effectiveness of the various treatment strategies,\nincluding alternative treatment combination used either in unselected patients or as targeted therapies.\nWhile the reporting is not consistent across the studies and a large number of ICERs are reported, most\nare in the hundreds of thousands of Euro or Dollars per QALY gained. Accordingly, these ICERs generally\nindicate that most of the therapies reviewed are not cost-effective.\nOverall this review does not appear to be of high quality. The unstructured reporting of results for many\ntreatment combinations and patient subgroups does not present the relevant evidence in an accessible\nformat. The lack of focus on any one particular therapy or patient subgroup means there is no clear\nmessage to report to decision makers. Furthermore, the review does not appear to critically appraise\nthe reviewed studies or assess the validity of the reported ICERs. Consequently, some inappropriately\ninterpreted cost-effectiveness ratios have been reported in the review (for example the ICERs reported\nfrom Handorf et al.). Despite this, the overall conclusion of the review that most recent treatments\nconsidered for NSCLC do not appear to be acceptably cost-effective appears broadly correct given the\nliterature cited.",

      "text": "Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing conventional versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for\nsurgically ineligible stage I NSCLC\nMitera et al. (2014) use a simple retrospective observational analysis to compare the costs and effects\nof conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the\ntreatment of stage I NSCLC. Their analysis indicates that SBRT is more costly and more effective than CFRT\nand has a cost-effectiveness ratio well within standard cost-effectiveness thresholds.\nThe analysis compares stage Ia and Ib NSCLC patients receiving CFRT or SBRT instead of surgical resection.\nThe analysis is a retrospective analysis of costs and mortality of patients at a Canadian hospital. The\nanalysis gives a detailed description of the costs captured in the analysis.\nThe results show that the patients receiving SBRT have mean survival of 3.8 years, while those receiving\nCFRT have a mean survival of 2.8 years. The analysis estimates that the costs of CFRT and SBRT are\nCAN$6,886 and CAN$8,042, respectively (€5,700 and €6,600 respectively in 2014 in inflation and PPP\nadjusted euro). The authors use these differences in costs and effects to report an ICER of CAN$1,120/LYG\n(€920/LYG). Accordingly, the low ICER estimate relative to commonly applied thresholds would suggest\nSBRT is a highly cost-effective alternative to CFRT.\nThe results of this study cannot be considered reliable, as it is unclear if the relatively large survival benefit\nof SBRT can be attributed to superior treatment effect or to differences in the patient characteristics\nbetween those receiving CFRT and SBRT. The introduction to the review itself notes that no randomised\nstudies have demonstrated any difference between CFRT and SBRT. Furthermore, there are potentially\nrelevant differences between the patient groups receiving each therapy, with more men and higher\nstage patients receiving CFRT than SBRT. No statistical testing is shown to examine the differences in the\npatient characteristics. Accordingly, the cost-effectiveness evidence presented in this study should be\ndisregarded.\nComparison of surgical intervention and stereotactic body radiation therapy for stage I high-risk\npatients\nPuri et al. (2012) presents a model based cost-effectiveness comparison of surgical resection and\nstereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for high risk patients with stage I lung cancer. They conclude\nthat while surgery is more costly than SBRT it is also more effective, supporting the cost-effectiveness of\nsurgical resection rather than SBRT.\nThe analysis combines a retrospective analysis of high-risk patients receiving either surgery or SBRT with\na simulation model. The observed recurrence rates from the observational study were adjusted using\npropensity score matching (PSM) with the aim of overcoming problems of selection bias between the\ntwo treatment groups. Using data from the PSM analysis they model the costs and effects of the two\nstrategies. The effect estimates are not adjusted for quality of life, but rather are reported in life years\ngained (LYG). Costs and effects do not appear to be discounted.\nThe reported results show surgery to be somewhat more effective, with an expected LYG of 0.45. Surgery\nis found to be more costly too, with incremental costs of $3,476 (€3,200/LYG in 2014 in inflation and PPP\nadjusted euro) and the resulting ICER is $7,753/LYG (€7,200/LYG). This ICER is well within conventionally\napplied thresholds, such as the €45,000/QALY threshold commonly used in Ireland.\nOverall this is a well described study. The attempt to correct for selection bias using PSM is appropriate and\nthe discussion gives a clear description of the possible limitations of this method. The principal potential\nproblem is that SBRT candidates are expected to have greater morbidity than those allocated to surgery\nand PSM may not be fully able to correct for this. The lack of discounting is a notable methodological\nflaw and means the reported ICER is likely to be somewhat of an underestimate. However, given the\nrelatively short amount of remaining life expectancy in most cases it is not likely that the discounted ICER\nwould be so much higher as to rise above commonly applied thresholds. The study authors recognise\nthe limits of the study design employed and suggest that prospective randomised studies are required\nto enhance confidence in the results reached. In conclusion, this report provides evidence of moderate\nquality supporting the cost-effectiveness of surgical resection rather than SBRT in high risk stage I lung\ncancer patients.\nCost-effectiveness analysis comparing conventionally fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic\nbody radiotherapy for stage I NSCLC\nSher et al. (2011) presents a CEA of three alternative therapies for patients with early stage NSCLC not\nsuitable for surgery. The analysis relates to peripheral tumours rather than those in the proximal bronchial\ntree. They compare radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT)\nand stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). They found 3D-CRT to be subject to extended dominance and\nSBRT to be the most costly and most effective, with a cost-effectiveness ratio relative to RFA that is within\ncommonly applied thresholds.\nThe analysis employs a model to combine estimates from the literature on disease progression rates, costs,\nand health related quality of life related to the three strategies. Parameters that are particularly important\nto the model are local recurrence rates under each of the three therapies. The model gives particular\nconsideration to adverse effects associated with the SBRT therapy. The analysis includes a detailed costing\nfrom the health payer perspective. The analysis also presents a range of sensitivity analyses.\nThe results show that RFA is the least costly and least effective treatment. 3D-CRT is more costly and\nmore effective, but subject to extended dominance, meaning it will never be a preferred strategy from\nthe cost-effectiveness perspective. SBRT is the most costly and most effective strategy. SBRT is estimated\nto yield an incremental QALY gain of over half a QALY relative to RFA, which is a large gain proportional to\nremaining life-expectancy in this case. The ICER of SBRT relative to RFA is $14,100/QALY (€12,500/QALY\nin 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). Accordingly, SBRT would clearly be considered cost-effective\nrelative to the thresholds of $50,000/QALY applied in the US and €45,000/QALY commonly applied in\nIreland. Sensitivity analyses never find 3D-CRT to be the preferred strategy and almost always find SBRT\nto be the preferred strategy.\nThis is a well presented study. The model is described adequately and the relevant costs and effects\nare accounted for. Discounting is applied appropriately. That 3D-CRT is dominated by other strategies is\nnot reflected clearly in the paper and the reporting of an incorrect ICER for this strategy is one notable\nproblem with the presentation of results but it does not affect the study’s conclusions. The base case\nresults and sensitivity analysis all support the conclusion that SBRT is likely to be cost-effective. The\nanalysis notes that 3D-CRT may be the preferred strategies for tumours in the centre of the chest, where\nSBRT is less well tolerated.",

The relationship of an attribute to the\ndisease is examined by comparing the diseased and nondiseased with regard\nto how frequently the attribute is present or, if quantitative, the levels of the\nattribute, in each of the groups. (CEBM website)\nA group or series of case reports involving patients who were given similar\ntreatment. Reports of case series usually contain detailed information about\nthe individual patients. This includes demographic information (for example,\nage, gender, ethnic origin) and information on diagnosis, treatment, response\nto treatment, and follow-up after treatment. (CEBM website)\nThe analytic method of epidemiologic study in which subsets of a defined\npopulation can be identified who are, have been, or in the future may be\nexposed or not exposed, or exposed in different degrees, to a factor or factors\nhypothesized to influence the probability of occurrence of a given disease\nor other outcome. The main feature of cohort study is observation of large\nnumbers over a long period (commonly years) with comparison of incidence\nrates in groups that differ in exposure levels. (CEBM website)\nThe extent to which a variable or intervention measures what it is supposed\nto measure or accomplishes what it is supposed to accomplish. The internal\nvalidity of a study refers to the integrity of the experimental design. The\nexternal validity of a study refers to the appropriateness by which its results\ncan be applied to non-study patients or populations. (CEBM website)\nA systematic review may or may not include a meta-analysis, which is a\nquantitative summary of the results. (CEBM website)\nAn epidemiological experiment in which subjects in a population are\nrandomly allocated into groups, usually called study and control groups, to\nreceive or not receive an experimental preventive or therapeutic procedure,\nmaneuver, or intervention. The results are assessed by rigorous comparison\nof rates of disease, death, recovery, or other appropriate outcome in the\nstudy and control groups. (CEBM website)\nThe application of strategies that limit bias in the assembly, critical appraisal,\nand synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. Systematic reviews\nfocus on peer-reviewed publications about a specific health problem and\nuse rigorous, standardised methods for selecting and assessing articles.\nA systematic review may or may not include a meta-analysis, which is a\nquantitative summary of the results.

Not all systematic reviews with statistically significant heterogeneity need be worrisome, and not all worrisome heterogeneity need be\nstatistically significant. As noted above, studies displaying worrisome heterogeneity should be tagged with a “-” at the end of their designated level.\n” Clinical Decision Rule (these are algorithms or scoring systems that lead to a prognostic estimation or a diagnostic category).\n** Validating studies test the quality of a specific diagnostic test, based on prior evidence. An exploratory study collects information and trawls the data (e.g.\nusing a regression analysis) to find which factors are ‘significant’.\n” “ ” Good reference standards are independent of the test, and applied blindly or objectively to applied to all patients. Poor reference standards are\nhaphazardly applied, but still independent of the test. Use of a non-independent reference standard (where the ‘test’ is included in the ‘reference’, or where\nthe ‘testing’ affects the ‘reference’) implies a level 4 study.\n” “ An “Absolute SpPin” is a diagnostic finding whose Specificity is so high that a positive result rules-in the diagnosis. An “Absolute SnNout” is a diagnostic\nfinding whose Sensitivity is so high that a negative result rules-out the diagnosis.\n§§§ Split-sample validation is achieved by collecting all the information in a single tranche, then artificially dividing this into “derivation” and “validation”\nsamples.\nTable 14 Grades of recommendations for diagnostic studies (Oxford CEBM, 2009)\nA Consistent level 1 studies.\nB Consistent level 2 or 3 studies; or\nExtrapolations from level 1 studies.\nC Level 4 studies; or\nExtrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies.\nD Level 5 evidence; or\nTroublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.\nExtrapolations are where data is used in a situation that has potentially clinically important differences than the original study situation.\nTable 15 Levels of Evidence for interventional studies (SIGN grading system 1999-2012)\n1++ High quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a very low risk of bias.\n1+ Well conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a low risk of bias.\n1- Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a high risk of bias.\n2++ High quality systematic reviews of case control or cohort studies.\nHigh quality case control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high\nprobability that the relationship is causal.\n2+ Well conducted case control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate\nprobability that the relationship is causal.\n2- Case control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the\nrelationship is not causal.\n3 Non-analytic studies (e.g. case reports, case series).\n4 Expert opinion.\nTable 16 Grades of recommendations for interventional studies (SIGN grading system 1999-2012)\nA At least one meta-analysis, systematic review, or RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target\npopulation; or\nA body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the target\npopulation, and demonstrating overall consistency of results.\nB A body of evidence including studies rated as 2++, directly applicable to the target population, and\ndemonstrating overall consistency of results; or\nExtrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++ or 1+.\nC A body of evidence including studies rated as 2+, directly applicable to the target population and\ndemonstrating overall consistency of results; or\nExtrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++\nD Evidence level 3 or 4; or\nExtrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+\nNote: the grade of recommendation does not necessarily reflect the clinical importance of the recommendation.",
