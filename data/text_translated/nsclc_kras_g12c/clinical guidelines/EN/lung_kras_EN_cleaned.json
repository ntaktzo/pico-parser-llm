This mutation is more\ncommon in non-squamous NSCLC and does not usually occur with other\nknown mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS-1. These other known\nmutations may have targeted treatments available but there is currently\nno targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. People with KRAS\nG12C mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC usually\nhave chemotherapy, a non-targeted treatment associated with adverse\neffects that affect health-related quality of life.

The clinical and patient experts noted that there is an\nunmet need for effective and tolerable treatments in this population.\nThey also highlighted that the lack of targeted treatment options can\nhave a psychological impact.

A matching-adjusted indire\ncomparison (MAIC) was used for the primary analysis of sotorasib versu\ndocetaxel. Results from CodeBreaK100 were used for sotorasib. Results\nfrom SELECT-1, a randomised controlled trial comparing selumetinib plu\ndocetaxel with docetaxel alone, were used for docetaxel. For the\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Therefore, a piecewise\napproach to hazard ratio estimates applied to the docetaxel arm of\nSELECT-1 was done using results from LUME-Lung 1, a randomised\ncontrolled trial comparing docetaxel with docetaxel plus nintedanib. A\nsupplementary analysis of sotorasib versus docetaxel was also done\nusing a propensity score weighting analysis (PSWA) approach, using da\nfrom CodeBreaK100 for sotorasib and the chemotherapy arm of the\nAmgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence study. The committee\nconcluded that an indirect treatment comparison is appropriate becaus\nthere are no head-to-head trials, but noted there were several issues\nwith the comparisons that introduced considerable uncertainty.\nSotorasib increases overall and progression-free survival\ncompared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib i\nindirect comparison\n3.5 The indirect treatment comparison showed that sotorasib is statistically\nsuperior in overall and progression-free survival compared with\ndocetaxel. This was based on the latest March 2021 data-cut of the\nCodeBreaK100 trial (the exact results are confidential and cannot be\nreported here). The supplementary analysis supported these results. Fo\nthe secondary analysis, the estimation of survival was implemented in\nthe model and extrapolated over the time horizon. This showed a mean\ngain in overall and progression-free survival for sotorasib compared wit\ndocetaxel plus nintedanib (the exact results are confidential and cannot\nbe reported here). The committee concluded that the indirect treatmen\ncomparisons show a survival benefit with sotorasib compared with\ndocetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib.\nThe unanchored MAIC using SELECT-1 data is appropriat\ndecision-making but has substantial uncertainty\n3.6 The company chose 4 covariates in the primary MAIC analysis for\nmatching: ECOG performance score, mean age, metastatic disease at\nbaseline and smoking status. These covariates were all perfectly\nmatched to SELECT-1 (the exact results are confidential and cannot be\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Some covariates identified as 'very important' by clinical\nexperts were excluded from matching by the company because of\nmissing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain\nmetastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The\ncompany mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the\ntrials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in\nCodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the\nproportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to\nCodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in\nconservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including\nKRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the\ncompany's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival\nare similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and\nKRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have\nbeen possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data.\nThe ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a\nPSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen\nFlatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more\ncomparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little\ndifference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also\nnoted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain\nmetastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains\nconsiderable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to\ndocetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative.\nThe committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for\nthe unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial\npopulation was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more\nrecent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial\nuncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis\nusing SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making.\nDocetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi\nhazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate\n3.7 In the secondary indirect treatment comparison of sotorasib versus\ndocetaxel plus nintedanib, the ERG highlighted uncertainties in the\nmodelling. The company modelled docetaxel and nintedanib in line with\nNICE's technology appraisal on nintedanib for previously treated locally\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\ning a\nadvanced, metastatic, or locally recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.\nThis was because a company-sourced UK advisory board confirmed that\na MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the\nuncertainty with not applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking\nstatus when these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also\nmentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the\nKaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in\nmortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a worse\nsurvival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone.\nThe Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight benefit of docetaxel compared\nwith docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then\ntransformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in\nthe modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert mentioned that\nin clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel\nplus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted\nthat nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment\nearlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company\nsuggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is\nanti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that\nsupport tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an\neffect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG\nsuggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and\n26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG\npreferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company\ndisagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The\ncommittee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded\nthat there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling,\nand that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate.",

The company stated that half the people\nwho were alive will have kept taking sotorasib at that point. Because\nsotorasib is taken until progression or unacceptable toxicity in\nCodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning could lead to biased\ncost-effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was\ndifficult to know how the treatment effect waning should be applied for\nsotorasib. However, they suggested that sotorasib should be considere\nin a similar way to other oral treatments for NSCLC. The clinical lead for\nthe Cancer Drugs Fund referred to an example of oral tyrosine kinase\ninhibitors showing high response rates. They noted that the disease ca\nprogress and people remain relatively well for some time before having\nsymptoms. The clinical expert agreed with this. The company highlighte\nthat sotorasib is not a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and that its mechanism o\naction and response rate would be different. The ERG disagreed with th\ncompany's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued benefit\nand highlighted that the evidence is still immature. In its base case, the\nERG preferred to apply treatment effect waning at 2 years and graduall\ndecrease the hazard ratio to 1 over 5 years. This was considered\noptimistic by the ERG. In addition, the ERG carried out additional scenar\nanalyses with treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years after starting\ntreatment with no gradual decrease in the hazard ratio. This is in line w\nsome other NSCLC appraisals. The committee noted that no direct trial\nevidence after the latest follow up at 15 months means that the\ntreatment effect beyond this period is uncertain.

This was because the ERG said that the\ntime-to-death utilities did not seem well informed and they were\ncomprised of a small sample size, especially near death. The committee\nunderstood that the health-related quality of life data was from the\nSeptember 2020 data-cut, therefore it was more immature. The ERG\nnoted that the health-state utility approach means that each health state\nis populated with more people. The committee noted that for a health-\nstate utility approach, the proportion of people in the progressed state\nthat are closer to death are not apparent because averages are taken.\nThe clinical expert highlighted that people need to be well enough to\nassess quality of life after progression. Therefore, the average is more\nlikely representing people who recently stopped treatment. The\ncommittee considered that if a randomised controlled trial was done, the\nhealth-related quality of life in both arms should be the same at the start\nof treatment. Therefore, this may need to be considered in the approach\nto modelling health-related quality of life in the future. The company\nmentioned that it is open to using health-state utilities if there is a\ndifference for sotorasib compared with chemotherapy after progression.\nThe committee concluded that there are uncertainties in using time-to-\ndeath and health-state utilities, but because both approaches may be\nplausible, it would consider these in its decision-making.\nSotorasib is an oral treatment with associated benefits, and a\ndisutility for the comparative intravenous treatment may be\nplausible\n3.10 Sotorasib is an oral targeted treatment. It is more tolerable and less\nresource intensive than chemotherapy. The clinical expert described the\nissues associated with intravenous treatments, such as adverse events\nand delays in treatment because of capacity issues in chemotherapy\nunits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The clinical expert\nhighlighted the benefits of oral treatment from an NHS and patient\nperspective, and the preference for it. The patient expert described the\nbenefits of having treatment at home and reducing inpatient time at the\nhospital. The company applied a utility decrement of 0.025 per cycle of\ntreatment to account for the cytotoxicity and intravenous administration\nof docetaxel and nintedanib. This was based on a study comparing\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\na\nerlotinib with docetaxel in advanced NSCLC (Lewis et al., 2010). The\nutilities in that study were derived through a visual analogue scale in the\nprogression-free health state. The ERG noted that the utilities (0.451 and\n0.426 for oral and intravenous therapy, respectively) in that study were\nlower than in CodeBreaK100 (0.734). The ERG said it was not opposed to\na treatment-related disutility for intravenous administration but\nhighlighted the lack of justification for the size of disutility. It also\nconsidered the exclusion of any potential disutility associated with\nsotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is\ntaken as 8 tablets once a day compared with docetaxel that is\nadministered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the\ncompany assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities\nfor a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged\nthat a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company\nidentified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1,\nresulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free\nsurvival base-case utility. As a result, the company determined that\nscenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04\nprogression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were\nappropriate to explore. The committee concluded that it would consider\nboth a disutility and no disutility associated with intravenous\nadministration in its decision-making.\nIt is appropriate to apply an equalised relative dose intensity\nsotorasib and its comparators\n3.11 The company applied a relative dose intensity that was lower for\nsotorasib (89.0%) compared with docetaxel (90.3%) and nintedanib\n(92.1%). The company stated that there was no reason to assume that\nthe relative dose intensity is truly lower for sotorasib, and any differences\nmay be from random sampling errors. The ERG suggested it was\nreasonable to apply an average 90.5% relative dose intensity instead.\nThe ERG preferred this conservative approach because of the impact on\ntreatment costs and the immaturity of trial data. The company disagreed\nwith equalised relative dose intensity because it considered the trial data\nmore valid. The clinical expert mentioned that the dose of sotorasib can\nbe modified depending on the level of unacceptable toxicity, whereas for\nchemotherapy, the maximum dose is normally applied. The committee\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\ny for\nr\nnoted that the proportion of people needing dose modifications in\nCodeBreaK100 was similar to SELECT-1.

The company stated that for non-targeted\ntherapies, real-world evidence studies suggest less than 10 months\noverall survival with second-line treatment and less than 7 months\noverall survival with third-line treatment. This was supported with a\nmedian overall survival of 7.9 months in SELECT-1 and median overall\nsurvival of 10.9 months in LUME-Lung 1. The committee accepted that\nsotorasib meets the short life expectancy criterion for end of life. It noted\na median overall survival gain from the indirect treatment comparisons of\nsotorasib with docetaxel alone (see section 3.5) from the latest\nMarch 2021 data-cut, at around 15 months of follow up (the exact results\nare confidential and cannot be reported here). In addition, the model\nestimated an undiscounted mean overall survival gain for sotorasib\ncompared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib (the exact\nresults are confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee\nagreed that sotorasib was likely to extend life by over 3 months and\ntherefore meets the extension to life criterion. However, it noted that\nthere were uncertainties with the unanchored indirect treatment\ncomparison methods (see section 3.4).
