This was based on the latest March 2021 data-cut of the\nCodeBreaK100 trial (the exact results are confidential and cannot be\nreported here). The supplementary analysis supported these results.

Some covariates identified as 'very important' by clinical\nexperts were excluded from matching by the company because of\nmissing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain\nmetastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The\ncompany mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the\ntrials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in\nCodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the\nproportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to\nCodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in\nconservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including\nKRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the\ncompany's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival\nare similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and\nKRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have\nbeen possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data.\nThe ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a\nPSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen\nFlatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more\ncomparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little\ndifference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also\nnoted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain\nmetastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains\nconsiderable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to\ndocetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative.\nThe committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for\nthe unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial\npopulation was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more\nrecent trial. The committee recognised that there are substantial\nuncertainties with this approach, but concluded that the primary analysis\nusing SELECT-1 for the MAIC is appropriate for decision-making.\nDocetaxel plus nintedanib modelling is uncertain, and applyi\nhazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate\n3.7 In the secondary indirect treatment comparison of sotorasib versus\ndocetaxel plus nintedanib, the ERG highlighted uncertainties in the\nmodelling. The company modelled docetaxel and nintedanib in line with\nNICE's technology appraisal on nintedanib for previously treated locally\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  P\ning a\nadvanced, metastatic, or locally recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.\nThis was because a company-sourced UK advisory board confirmed that\na MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the\nuncertainty with not applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking\nstatus when these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also\nmentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the\nKaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in\nmortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a worse\nsurvival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone.\nThe Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight benefit of docetaxel compared\nwith docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then\ntransformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in\nthe modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert mentioned that\nin clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel\nplus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted\nthat nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment\nearlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company\nsuggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is\nanti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that\nsupport tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an\neffect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG\nsuggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and\n26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG\npreferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company\ndisagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial. The\ncommittee highlighted the importance of face validity and concluded\nthat there are uncertainties in the docetaxel plus nintedanib modelling,\nand that a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 and 6 months is appropriate.",
