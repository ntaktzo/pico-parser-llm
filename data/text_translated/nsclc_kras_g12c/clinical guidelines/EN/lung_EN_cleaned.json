However, routine\nbrain imaging is expensive, and the evidence showed that it does not always offer a good balance of benefits and costs.\nIn people with stage II and IIIA disease, the benefits of brain imaging outweigh the costs because:\n• brain metastases are more common than in stage I disease\n• people can start early treatment for metastases if they are identified, which improves\nprognosis\n• some people with brain metastases will not have radical treatment (depending on\nfactors such as the number of metastases, prognosis and patient preference), and this reduces costs.\nIn people with clinical stage I NSCLC and no neurological symptoms, the prevalence of detectable brain metastases is fairly low (around 4%) compared with people with stage II\nor IIIA disease. People with stage I NSCLC who do have brain metastases often still have\nradical lung treatment, which is much more rarely the case for people with stage IIIA\nNSCLC. Overall, the lower prevalence of metastases and smaller reduction in numbers of\npeople having radical treatment mean that the benefits of brain imaging in this population are too low to justify the costs.\nThe 2018 review only examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of imaging after the treatment plan has been decided, but the committee noted that it could be more efficient\nto conduct CT brain imaging alongside initial staging CT. With this in mind, the committee\nmade a recommendation for research on routine brain imaging with CT at initial diagnosis and/or staging.\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Lobectomy is a\ngood compromise between preserving pulmonary function and being more likely to remove cancerous cells compared with sublobar resection.\nFor people with stage I–IIA (T1a–T2b, N0, M0) NSCLC, the evidence showed that:\n• if they decline lobectomy or it is contraindicated, sublobar resection and SABR both\nprovide better survival outcomes than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, although it is not clear which of these 2 is better\n• if they decline any surgery or it is contraindicated, SABR provides better survival\noutcomes than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, and people often prefer it because it involves fewer hospital visits\n• if surgery and SABR are contraindicated, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy\nprovides better survival outcomes than no radiotherapy.\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights  Page 40\nFor people with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC who cannot tolerate chemoradiotherapy or who decline it, the evidence was not strong enough to recommend conventional radiotherapy\nover hyper-fractionated regimens or vice versa. However, people who cannot tolerate\nchemoradiotherapy may also be unable to tolerate radical radiotherapy, so this will not be an option for everyone with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC. For an explanation of the\nrecommendations covering surgery in this group, see the rationale on management of stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC.\n55 Gy in 20 fractions is the most common conventional radical radiotherapy regimen in the\nUK. If conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is used, a total radiation dose of 60 Gy\nprovides better survival outcomes and fewer adverse events than 74 Gy. A total dose of\n60 to 66 Gy is also normal NHS practice.\nThere are not many randomised controlled trials comparing SABR with surgery (lobectomy or sublobar resection). SABR is non-invasive, so if it is as effective as surgery then it may\nbe a preferable option for many people with lung cancer. There are also various factors\nthat may make SABR less costly than surgery. For example, it is usually delivered as\noutpatient treatment. There might also be subgroups for whom different forms of surgery\nor SABR might be the most cost-effective options.

An analysis of multiple trials showed improved progressionfree survival and cost effectiveness for chemoradiotherapy with surgery, compared with\nchemoradiotherapy alone. There was an 89% probability that chemoradiotherapy and\nsurgery improved average overall survival time compared with chemoradiotherapy.\nHowever, the evidence in favour of chemoradiotherapy and surgery involved indirect comparisons, and no head-to-head trials showed meaningful differences in overall survival\nfor any of the interventions.
