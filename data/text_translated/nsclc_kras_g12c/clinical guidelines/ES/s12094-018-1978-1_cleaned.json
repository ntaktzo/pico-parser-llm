      "text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 85% of all lung cancers. The last few years have seen the develop-\nment of a new staging system, diagnostic procedures such as liquid biopsy, treatments like immunotherapy, as well as deeper\nmolecular knowledge; so, more options can be offered to patients with driver mutations. Groups with specific treatments\naccount for around 25% and demonstrate significant increases in overall survival, and in some subgroups, it is important\nto evaluate each treatment alternative in accordance with scientific evidence, and even more so with immunotherapy. New\ntreatments similarly mean that we must reconsider what should be done in oligometastatic disease where local treatment\nattains greater value.\nKeywords NSCLC · Chemotherapy · Immunotherapy · Targeted therapies · Radiotherapy\n* M.
