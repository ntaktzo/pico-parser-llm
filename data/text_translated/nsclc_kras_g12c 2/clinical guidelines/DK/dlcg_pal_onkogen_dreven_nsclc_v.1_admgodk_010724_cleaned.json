      "text": "Oncogne-driven lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous and biologically unstable cancer with many different treatment options. The group of patients constitutes about 60 percent of all patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The treatment options are complex and based on the genomic profiling of patients' tumors and/or free tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA). The understanding of the molecular biology mechanisms is in rapid development following the introduction of next generation sequence (NGS). The development is towards a treatment, tailored to the individual gene bugs (variants); the EGFR mutation must be treated quite differently from the protein-change gene bug (variant) in EGFR gene results (e.g. EGFR exon 19 del versus EGFR exon 20 induction). Because of this deeper understanding of disease biology and the derived even more targeted treatment, the development of new drugs will increasingly be based on studies with fewer patient populations. Our classic assessment of efficacy on the basis of large randomised phase III studies will be developed.\n\nPatients with oncogen-driven NSCLC have generally a better prognosis than the other patients with NSCLC. However, the patient group often has less comorbidity and no or sparring history of back (not applicable to the KRAS G12C variant) compared to the other group of patients with the NSCLC. Oncogen-driven NSCLC can occur in smokers and therefore all patients with adenocarcinomas or NSCLCNOS should be cleared with a broad genomic profile, independent of smoking history. Furthermore, genomic prognosis of tumours from patients with squamous carcinoma at young age or patients with squamous cell carcinoma should be considered in the clinical group of patients with no longer than patients with placebo.",

      "text": "The treatment decision should therefore reflect this development. Therefore, it is recommended that patients in progression under TKI have a new genetic profiling on progressive metastasis and that this profile should be discussed on a molecular tumor board (if available) or with colleagues in pathological ward. In general, it is recommended to treat the individual patient as long as possible with relevant TKIs, also described in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. The way in which progression appears in patients during TKI treatment is important for the treatment selection. In case of symptomatic systemic progression, a biopsy from a prognostic metastasis may be considered, at both the next treatment selection. In the following section, the evidence of the recommended treatment may be considered.\n\nThe following variants should be examined, in line with ESMO guidelines, on both diagnostic biopsy and on cooken-driven NSCLC - Selected patients on both diagnostic biopsy and on progression during special on cooken-driven treatment (see descriptions of resistance mechanisms under the individual variants recommendations): 5. BRAFV600E 6. NTR R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R (all in exon 18-21 with description of variant) 2. ALK fusion (all variants with description of fusion partners) 3. ALK variants with description of fusion partners) 3. ALK variants other 4. ROS1 fusion (all variants with description of fusion partner) 5. BRAFV600E 6.\n\nTherefore, there is a potential solution to these challenges to test circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, as a supplement to tissue biopsies. The detection of ctDNA in plasma is due to the excretion of ctDNA in the bloodstream (shedding tumor), but the amount of secreted tumor DNA may vary from tumor to tumor. According to ESMO guidelines, for patients with advanced oncogen-driven NSCLC, there are validated and sufficiently sensitive ctDNA tests that can be used routinely in clinical practice. ctDNA analyses can be usefully used when repeated analyses are needed or when tissue biopsies are not possible or inappropriate. The interpretation of ctDNA results should not be used to rule out the presence of a variant. Other examples of fall limitations for ctDNA-analyses are not fully implemented in DK and are therefore not available as standard in several regions.\n\nIn addition to the above, the risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free of risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free of risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk-free risk should be considered in order to be considered in order to avoid, and to avoid risk-free risk.\n\nThe median time to response was 6,1 week (time of first evaluation) and shows a short time to efficacy of osimertinib. The observed excess effect for osimertinib was similar in all subgroups (age, PD-L1 status (5)[1b], EGFR variant, CNS metastases). Adverse reactions in the FLAURA study were not observed to increase the incidence of ≥ grade 3 adverse events (42% versus 47%), compared to erlotinib/gefitinib, despite the fact that osimertinib was given for a long time (20.7 months versus 11.5 months). The most common ≥ grade 3 adverse events under osimertinib are rash/dry skin (1%) and diarrhoea (2%).\n\nThe preliminary OS data were presented on ASCO 2024: OS for the combination= NR, for osimertinib monotherapy=38.6 months. Adverse events ≥ 3 were 64% for the combination vs 27% for osimertinib. SAE (all) was 38% in the combination arm vs 19% in the osimertinib monotherapy arm. The most frequent adverse events were bone marrow effects: 71% (co-arm) vs 24% (osimertinib arm). There was no difference in the degree of pneumonitis between the two arms (3-4%).\n\nThe study shows adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 (58.3%) for 2nd line osimertinib after 1.2 generation TKI and EGFR T790M variant. PFS was not reported in the study. The study describes adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 vs 8%) for patients ≥ 65 years of age. There was no difference in type of adverse reactions. d. Patients with the PS ≥ 2 ESMO guideline recommend EGFR TKI for patients in this patient group based on ORR, depth of treatment and based on handy adverse reactions (13) [5].\n\nThe ALK-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Butt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-t-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Tt-Tt-Tt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-Bt-BtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtBtB\n\nThe study showed a greater effect of alectinib in terms of 12-month events-free rate, 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. PFS was 25.7 months for alectinib and 10.8 months for alectinib vs. Intracranial response rate was 81% for crizotinib versus 50% for crizotinib. Updated analysis (23)[1b] after longer follow-up showed median PFS 34.8 months for alectinib vs. 10.9 months for crizotinib. Intracranial response - measured in a smaller group of patients with measurable brain staffis was 81% for alectinib.\n\nThe study showed: median PFS for lorlatinib was NR and median PFS for crizotinib were 9.3 mdr (26) [1b]. In patients without brain metastases, a significant intracranial ORR 82% was observed in the Lorlatinib group versus 23% for crizotinib versus 23% for crizotinib. 3-year PFS was 64% for lorlatinib and 19% for crizotinib. In patients without brain metastases, a significant intracranial ORR 82% was observed in the Lorlatinib group and 25 (23 %) in the crizotinib group intracranial progression. The most frequent adverse events during treatment with crizotinib were recommended for patients without placebos.",

Unlike other ALK-TKI patients, co-mutation in TP53 has less influence on the effect of lorlatinib (32) [2b] is particularly associated with significantly longer PFS in patients with EML4-ALK variant 3. In contrast to other ALK-TKI patients, a mPFS patient has less influence on the effect of lorlatinib (32) [1b]. In the EML4-ALK variant 3 patient group, the placebo-ALK variant 3 and co-existing TP53 patients can be seen as a mPFS patient with 20 ms.\n\nFor patients without cerebral metastasis, the crizotinib is an alternative to entrectinib. ENTRECTINIB Entrectinib is approved by MRI and equivalent to crizotinib to 1st-line treatment of ROS1 translocated NSCLC based on an integrated analysis of three phase 1-2 studies (34)[2b]. ORR was 77% and median DOR was 24.6 months mPFS was 19.0 months. The most frequent AEs grade 3-4 were weight gain (8%) and neutropenia (4%). CNS metastasisation In a retrospective study investigating patients with ROS1 translocated NSCLC treated with crizotinib had 36% brain metastases at the time of diagnosis (35)[4].\n\nThe most frequent RET partners were KIF5B (45% vs. patients) and CCDC6 (10% vs. patients) and there was longer treatment of the placebo and placebo.\n\nPatients with active BRAF V600E and performance status 0-2 can be offered 1st line treatment with chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy or immuno immuno immuno therapy according to non-oncoke-driven NSCLC guidelines (B) Litterature and survival Ad. recommendation 6 Patients with active BRAF V600E can be offered 1st line treatment with chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy or immunotherapy monotherapy according to non-oncoke-driven NSCLC guidelines (B) Litterature and exercise Ad. recommendation 6 Patients with active BRAF V600E and performance status 0-2 can be offered 1st line treatment with chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy or immunotherapy monotherapy according to non-oncoke-driven NSCLC Guidelines (B) Litteratures and evidence are not available. recommendation 6 Patients with active BRAF V600E can be offered 1st line treatment with chemotherapy +/-/-Imone can be offered 1st line treatment with chemotherapy +/- or immuno therapy according to non-onclogin drive NS C Guidelines (B) L A drug and review should be considered.

The efficacy of encorafenib and binimetinib for BRAF V600E mutated NSCLC patients was studied in Phase 2 study PHAROS (42)[2b]. Both previously treated patients and patients who had received first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy plus/minus immunotherapy were included. ORR of 75% and median DOR could not be estimated (unripened data) for the treatment naïve group vs ORR of 46% and median DOR 16.7 months for the previously treated patients. mPFS could not be estimated (unripping data) for the treatment naïve and was 9.3 months for the previously treated patients.

      "text": "In a retrospective study, data were available from 20 NSCLC patients who had received different types of chemotherapy and achieved a PFS of 4.0 months and an OS of 9.5 months. Twelve of the 20 patients who received Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy had an ORR of 33.3 % (43)[2b]. In another retrospective study, 3 of 11 patients with NSCLC treated with chemotherapy achieved a partial response (44)[2b]. Since these data are not head-to-head comparison, they should be interpreted with caution and may only give a weak idea of what can be achieved with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with METex14.\n\nIn addition to the above, the risk-benefit analysis of patients with oncogen-driven NSCLC77 is limited to immunotherapy monotherapy IMMUNOTARGET (39)[2b] and in the Keynote 042 study (50) [1b] there was no difference between ORR and mPFS between patients with KRAS mutation and KRAS wild type. Immunet: 271 patients with KRAS mutations included. ORR was 26% and mPFS was 2.5 months mOS was 13.5 months. Keynote 042: mPFS 12 months for patients with KRAS mutation. 9. Patients with active EGFR exon20 ins/ ERBB2 (HER2) /NTRK variants and PS 0-2 can be offered 1st line treatment with platinum-duble chemotherapy (B) Litterature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 9 EGFR exon 20 insertions Patients with NSCLC and active EGFR exon 20 ins can be offered with platinum-duble chemotherapy.\n\nThe case reports have shown the efficacy of EG TKIs, also osimertinib (ORR 50%) (58, 59) [4]. On this basis, one can consider offering 1. line osimertinib to this variant during close response monitoring. ERBB2(HER2) mutation For description of ERBB2 variants / HER2 see recommendation 18. Therefore, in EMA, approved HER-directed TKIs, antibodies or ADCs, as the 1st line treatment of ERBB2 (HER2) mutated / amplified / or for overexpression of HER2 receptor in NSCLC. Therefore, according to recommendation for palliative 1st line treatment to patients with non-oncook dressed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. According to the ESMO consensus report for HER2 NSCLC (60)[5] limited effect of chemotherapy +/-immunity therapy to this patient group and patients can therefore be offered inclusion in Danish studies if possible.\n\nThe majority of patients with active other rare EGFR variants and PS 0-2 can also be offered first line treatment with osimertinib (B) Literature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 10 Patients with rare EGFR variants can be offered 1st line osimertinib according to ESMO and NCCN guidelines. Aflatinib is also recommended by the two guidelines but is not available in the UK without prior application by the Medicines Authority. The rare EGFR variants are 10-14% of all EGFR variants. The most frequent studies of the rare EGFRs are therefore available.\n\nG719: PFS 5.1 months, L861Q: PFS 22.7 months, S768I: PFS 9.4 months. However, the subgroup analyses are based on few patients and thus uncertain. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of LUX-lung 2/3/6 studies (phase II and randomised phase III) was conducted as an examination of the efficacy of afatinib in patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC. The post-hoc analysis showed for patients with rare variants (EGFR exon 18 G719X, EGFR exon 20 S768I and EGFR exon 21 L861LXX) patients.\n\nIn addition, patients (relevant residual life, AT and performance status) should be analysed with a broad NGS panel to investigate for acquired targetable resistance mutations. a. Histological transformation Fifteen percent of patients in progression may develop a multiple progression to SCLC or planocellullary carcinoma.\n\nThe most frequently reported grade 3 or over adverse events were: Diare (8.3%) and amylase/lipase elevation (33.3%). TATTON study (Phase 1b study) (72) [3b] investigated the effect of the combination osimertinib plus MET inhibitor savoliinib to the same patient population (B1: patients in progression on 3rd generation TKI) and showed ORR of 33%, PFS of 5.5 months and DOR 9.5 months. Over half of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 adverse events.\n\nThe same line of studies continued to apply to both PFS (1,3/8,2 months versus 4,2 months) and CNS PFS (12,8/12,5 months versus 8,3 months). Several adverse events were seen in the amivantamab arms compared to chemotherapy: SAE (all) 32-52% vs 20%. Adverse reactions ≥ 3: 72-92% vs 48%. The most frequent adverse reactions were bone marrow effects. An increased risk of VTE was observed for the amivantamab arms 10%-22% vs 5%. Treatment ceased in 10-22% vs 4% of patients. Combination therapy amivantamab/chemotherapy is not approved. Amivantamab monotherapy is not approved by EMA, to classic EGFR variants or MET variants (limited evidence) and therefore cannot be recommended as second line treatment for the classic patients outside controlled trials. c. Chemotherapy under continued osimateinib There are no prospective studies investigating the efficacy of continued osimatertinib in no chemotherapy under resistance.\n\nThe most frequent adverse events were bone marrow exposure: 71% (co-abdominal arm) vs 24% (osimertinib arm). There was no difference in the degree of pneumoniatis between the two arms (3-4%). An ESMO expert concensus report from 2022 (2) [5] recommends the combination osimertinib plus chemotherapy for patients with extra-cranial progression during osimertinib and concomitant stable asymptomatic cerebral metastases. The combination osimertinib plus chemotherapy is not approved. Therefore, at the DoLG meeting on 11/6 2024, the addition of chemotherapy to osimertinib in association with progression during osimertinib discussed.\n\nIMpower 150 (77) [1b] is a Phase 3, 3-arm study: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus platinum-dubled chemotherapy (ABP) versus atezolizumab plus platinum-dublet (AP) versus bevacizumab plus platinum-dublet (BP). In a subgroup analysis for 124 patients (78 patients prior EGFRTKI) with EGFR variants, there was no difference in efficacy between athezolizumab plus platinum-dublet (AP) versus bevazizumab plus platinum-dublet (BP). OS was numerically better in Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus platinum-dublet chemotherapy (ABP) 27.8 versus 18.1 months (AP) versus 14.9 months (BP).\n\nThe efficacy of pembrolizumab to TKI naïve patients with advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC, PD-L1 ≥ 1% (≥ 50% in 74% of patients). The study stopped early due to lack of efficacy. A randomised phase II study (87) [2b] examined the efficacy of nivolumab against platinum-dubled chemotherapy to patients resistant to EGFR TKI. Hundred-two patients were included and the study showed significant improvement of PFS in favor of the chemotherapy arm (PFS 1.7 months) versus 5.6 months (chemo) independent of PD-L1 status. There was no difference in OS.

The second study (112)[2b] examined the effect of HER2 double blockade plus docetaxel in patients with NSCLC and no further treatment options. The second study (112)[2b] examined the effect of HER2 double blockade plus docetaxel in patients with NSCLC HER 2 mutated, 2.-3.- line and PS 0-2.\n\nThe study was performed in the following studies: the study was performed in the following studies: the study was performed in the following studies: the study was conducted in the following studies: the study was conducted in the following studies: the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies: the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies: the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies, the study was conducted in the same studies as in the same studies in the same studies as in the same studies, the same as in the same studies in the same studies as in the same studies, the same as in the same studies in the same studies as in the other studies in the same studies.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions were taste changes (35.2%), diarrhoea (31.1%), fatigue (27,5%), and weight gain Laroractinib was 33.9 mg. in NTRK-merged NSCLC patients by pooled results from 2 phase 1/2 basked trials (20 patients) (62.2%).

Patient values and preferences There is not expected much variation in patients' preferences as the recommended medicinal products have a better effect and less adverse effects than chemotherapy. Rationale Recommendations's wording: \"should' is used when the recommendation reflects MR treatment guidelines. \"Consider: Use when the recommendation does not reflect MR treatment guidelines but reflects the EMA guidelines. Comments and considerations Parts of the guideline recommendations can only be obtained by prior approval in the region's medical committees. In the DoLG, there is a difference in the assessments of the medical committees across the regions. Furthermore, there is a difference between the resources of each department to carry out an application process. The following guide (see Annex 2) and the guideline itself, in its form, is an attempt to facilitate the work of the individual treating physician/ department in the application process and thus ensure one's treatment of patients across the regions.",

The management group of the clinical quality database has the mandate to decide on the database's indicator sets, including which specific processes and results are monitored in the database. Parts of the guideline recommend treatments that have not yet been assessed in MRI. It is therefore suggested that indicators be established that allow 1) monitoring of the regions' permissions for the treatment of recommendations and 2) the effectiveness of the treatments (e.g. ORR, PFS and DOR).",
