      "text": "The systematic research of the KRAS mutation is recommended before starting the 1st treatment line of the CBNPC. The pronostic or predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation is currently poorly defined in the CBNPC, and there is no (before the provision of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib)) specific treatment targeting this mutation. The current therapeutic management of the CBNPC is identical whether or not patients have a KRAS mutation (including G12C). At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended to propose a systematic second-line treatment, whether or not patients have responded to a 1st metastatic line. The nature of this treatment depends on the molecules used previously, on the ECOG score and on histology: - Patients treated with immunotherapy in 1st-line, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, high-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-, low-level, low-level, low-level, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-level, low, low- not, low-, low- not, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-, low-\n\nGiven the currently poorly defined prognostic and predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation in CBNPC, and the lack of comparative data of acceptable methodological quality, the place of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) vis-à-vis the available therapeutic alternatives (chemotherapy, immunotherapy) cannot be specified. It should be stressed that, in this context, where no comparable data of acceptable methodological quality is available to guarantee the strength of the conclusion on the effect of treatment with LUMYKRAS (sotorasib), the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapeutic strategy is accompanied by a greater risk-taking than for medicinal products whose efficacy is based on a comparison with an appropriate methodology.",

Sotorasib has been associated with transient elevations in serum transaminase levels (ALT and ASAT). These elevations have been reduced or resolved by dose adjustment or definitive discontinuation of treatment and have resulted in no hepatic impairment or death in clinical studies. Among patients with hepatotoxicity, 38% had hepatotoxicity that resulted in discontinuation of treatment or dose reduction. Overall, 26% of patients with hepatotoxicity received concomitantly-absorbed corticosteroids.\n\nThe treatment will be permanently discontinued if no other potential cause of PI/inflammatory pneumopathy is identified (see section 4.2).' Use data The laboratory provided the results of the first quarterly synthesis report of the cohort ATU, covering the period from August 09, 2021 to October 29, 2021. As a reminder, the wording of this cohort ATU was: \"Sotorasib is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with non-small cell bronchial cancer (NCBC) KRAS p.G12C metastatic mutation, pre-treated.\" A total of 447 requests for access to treatment were made during this period, 7 of which were denied. Of the 440 accepted applications, 414 patients were considered to be treated (negotiated by the laboratory) with a drug. Of these, 403 patients were considered to be exposed to sotorasib (11 patients who had never initiated treatment). The 414 patients considered to be treated were described in the remainder of this subsection.\n\nGiven the insufficiency of response related to this low number of patients, and the possibility of bias, follow-up data (effectiveness or tolerance) will not be described. Summary & Discussion The request for inclusion of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the monotherapy indication in the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC, with the KRAS G12C mutation, whose disease progressed after at least one previous systemic treatment line, is based primarily on a non-comparative Phase 2 \"basket\" study (CodeBreak 100) and indirect comparison data. CodeBreak 100 is a \"basket\" study that included adult patients with advanced solid tumours with the KRAS G12C mutation. The primary judgement criterion for the cohort of patients with an NSCLC was the objective response rate, evaluated by an independent review committee, according to the RECIST criteria. 1.1 Only data from the CBNPC cohort were used for this assessment. 简 Efficacy (of which quality of life) A total of 126 patients received patients with a prior cohort was considered to have been considered to have been identified as having been identified as having been identified as having been identified as having been identified as having been identified as having had been identified as having been identified as having had been identified as having been identified as having had had had been not been not been identified.\n\nThe median duration of response was approximately 8.4 months (IC95%: 6.9-8.4), progression-free survival of 6.7 months (IC95%: 4.9-8.1) and overall survival of 12.0 months (9.5-NE). The follow-up exploratory data suggested similar results. An indirect comparison was performed using patients included in the CodeBreak study, and those treated by standard treatment in the ESME cohort, using a non-anchored MAIC (matching adjusted indirect comparison) method. However, the main underlying hypothesis of this type of method for the recovery of group comparability, i.e. the exhaustive consideration of the confusion factors, is not verified. However, a very small number of these factors could be introduced into the main adjustment model, either because of the absence of a collection of these factors, or to maintain a sufficient sample size of these factors in the group.\n\nGiven the non-comparative design of the study, no formal conclusions can be drawn on the quality of life. 的 Tolerance The safety data of the CodeBreak 100 study are derived from the data freeze of March 15, 2021, allowing the largest decline. The safety population was composed of 126 patients, with a median duration of treatment of 24 weeks (min-max: 1-77). Almost all patients reported an adverse event (AE) (99%). The proportion of IEs of grades ≥ 3 was 61%, that of serious IEs of 55%, that of IEs leading to discontinuation of treatment of 9%, and that of IEs evolving towards death of 16%. The events of special interest were reported in 39% of patients. The occurrences of special interest were reported in the number of patients. The number of IEs of grades ≥ 3 was reported to be 61%, that of IEs leading to discontinuation of treatment of 9%, and that of IEss was reported to be related to death of 16%.

However, it should be noted that: - the non-compromising design allows only an estimate of the absolute effect of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib), and not its additional relative efficacy in relation to the efficacy of existing treatments, the placebo effect and the natural evolution of the disease; - this result was observed in a selected population (notably with ECOG 0 or 1, the absence of active brain metastasis): the transposability of the results to a population of worse prognosis (ECOG > 1, active brain metastasis) cannot be assured; and the safety profile was marked by an incidence of adverse events of grade ≥ 3 in nearly two patients (61%) and that of serious adverse events in more than two patients (55%), taking into account efficacy and safety data (preliminary data in a non-comparative study while clinically relevant comparators were available), additional bounds in terms of quality of grades ≥ 3 in nearly two patients (61%) and that of two patients had serious adverse events in more than one patient (55%).\n\n1-Studies in the CBNPC Availability Name of the Study Diagram data Phase III randomised, open-label, versus docetaxel, in CodeBreak End 2022 - early adult patients with advanced CBNPC with KRAS G12C mutation, previously treated IFCT-2012 Retrospective observational study including patients Lung Fin 2022 treated in the context of the CBNPC KG12Ci PLACE IN THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY Systematic research for the KRAS mutation is recommended before starting the first treatment line of the CBNPC.

Given the currently poorly defined prognostic and predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation in the CBNPC, and the absence of comparative data of acceptable methodological quality, the place of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) vis-à-vis the available therapeutic alternatives (chemotherapy, immunotherapy) cannot be specified. It should be noted that, in this context, no comparable acceptable methodological quality data is available to guarantee the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of the treatment by LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) with a BREADness of the drug is considered to be a BREADness of the drug.\n\nThe efficacy/adverse effects ratio is poorly established due to: - the lack of robust comparison data when clinically relevant comparators were available; - the weakness of the demonstration of efficacy: preliminary data from a non-comparative Phase I/II study; - frequent and serious adverse reactions (including hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity types). - non-specific therapeutic alternatives to the KRAS G12C mutation exist, in a context where the prognostic and predictive value of this mutation is poorly defined and the lack of specific treatment (before the provision of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib)). 的 This is a treatment option in patients who have received at least one previous systemic treatment line",

LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) is not likely to have an additional impact on public health. Considering all of these elements, the Commission considers that the medical service rendered by LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) is low in the indication of the MAH. The Commission gives a favourable opinion on the inclusion on the list of reimbursable specialties for social policy holders and on the list of authorised specialties for use by communities in the indication of the MAH and at the dosages of the MAH. The Commission conditions the continued low MRL to the re-evaluation of this specialty within a maximum of one year on the basis of the results of the proposed Phase III study for the reimbursement of the proposed medical service for patients with a KBPC prior to the mutation.",

The population of analysis The efficacy analyses were carried out in the population known as full analysis set, corresponding to patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib + with at least one initial injury evaluable according to the RECIST criteria 1.1. The safety analyses were carried out in the tolerance population, corresponding to patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib. Major amendments to the protocol - March 08, 2021: addition of an additional arm to 240 mg to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of this dose (results available at the end of 2022 – early 2023).",
